         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The former Part, <hi>viz.</hi> The Matter, lies deep in Nature, and requires much Reſearch into Natural Philoſophy to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold it; to find how Sounds are made, and

               <p>IN General (to paſs by what is not pertinent to this Deſign) Sence and Experience confirm theſe following Properties of Sound.</p>
               <p n="1">1. All Sound is made by Motion, <hi>viz.</hi> by Percuſſion with Colliſion of the Air.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That Sound may be propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and carried to Diſtance, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a <hi>Mdium</hi> by which to paſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This <hi>Medium</hi> (to our Purpoſe) is Air.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As far as Sound is propagated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the <hi>Medium;</hi> ſo far alſo the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion paſſeth. For (if we may not ſay that the Motion and Sound are one and the ſame thing, yet at leaſt) it is
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59863:7"/>neceſſarily conſequent, that if the Motion ceaſe, the Sound muſt alſo ceaſe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Sound, where it meets with no Obſtacle, paſſeth in a Sphere of the <hi>Medium,</hi> greater or leſs, according to the Force and Greatneſs of the Sound: Of which Sphere the ſonorous Body is as the Centre.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Sound, ſo far as it reacheth, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſech the <hi>Medium,</hi> not in an Inſtant, but in a certain uniform Degree of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity, calculated by <hi>Gaſſendus,</hi> to be about the Rate of 276 Paces, in the ſpace of a ſecond Minute of an Hour. And where it meets with any Obſtacle, it is ſubject to the Laws of Reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is the Cauſe of Eccho's, Meliorations, and Augmentations of Sound.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Sound, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Motion of Sound, or ſounding Motion, is carried through the <hi>Medium</hi> or Sphere of Activity, with an <hi>Impetus</hi> or Force which ſhakes the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59863:7"/>free <hi>Medium,</hi> and ſtrikes and ſhakes every Obſtacle it meets with, more or leſs, according to the vehemency of the Sound, and Nature of the Obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and Nearneſs of it to the Centre, or ſonorous Body. Thus the impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Motions of the Sound of Thunder, or of a Cannon, ſhake all before it, even to the breaking of Glaſs Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. The Parts of the ſounding Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy are moved with a Motion of Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, or Vibration, as is evident in a Bell or Pipe, and moſt manifeſt in the ſtring of a muſical Inſtrument.</p>
               <p n="9">9. This Trembling, or Vibration, is either equal and uniform, or elſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal and irregular; and again, ſwif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or ſlower, according to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the ſonorous Body, and Quality and Manner of Percuſſion; and from hence ariſe Differences of Sounds.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The Trembling, or Vibration
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59863:8"/>of the ſonorous Body, by which the particular Sound is conſtituted and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminated, is impreſſed upon, and carried along the <hi>Medium</hi> in the ſame Figure and Meaſure, otherwiſe it would not be the ſame Sound, when it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives at a more diſtant Ear, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Tremblings and Vibrations (which may be called Undulations) of the Air or <hi>Medium,</hi> are all along of the ſame Velocity and Figure, with thoſe of the ſonorous Body, by which they are cauſed.</p>
               <p>The Differences of Sounds, as of one Voice from another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (beſides the Difference of Tune, which is cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Difference of Vibrations) ariſe from the Conſtitution and Figure, and other Accidents of the ſonorous Body.</p>
               <p n="11">11. If the ſonorous Body be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitely conſtituted, <hi>i. e.</hi> of Parts ſolid, or tenſe, and regular, fit, being ſtruck, to receive and expreſs the Tremulous
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59863:8"/>Motions of Sound, equally and ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then it will render a certain and even Harmonical Tone or Tune, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with Pleaſure, and judged and meaſured by the Ear: Otherwiſe it will produce an obtuſe or uneven Sound, not giving any certain or diſcernable Tune.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Of Sound Harmonick.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE firſt and great Principle upon which the Nature of Harmonical Sounds is to be found out and diſcovered, is this: That the Tune of a Note (to ſpeak in our vulgar Phraſe) is conſtituted by the Meaſure and Proportion of Vibrations of the ſonorous Body; I mean, of the Velocity of thoſe Vibrations in their Recourſes.</p>
               <p>For, the frequenter the Vibrations are, the more acute is the Tune; the ſlower and fewer they are in the ſame Space of Time, by ſo much the more grave is the Tune. So that any given Note of a Tune, is made by one cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Meaſure of Velocity of Vibrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; <hi>viz.</hi> Such a certain Number of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59863:9"/>Courſes and Recourſes. <hi>e. g.</hi> of a Chord or String, in ſuch a certain Space of Time, doth conſtitute ſuch a certain determinate Tune. And all ſuch Sounds as are Uniſons, or of the ſame Tune with that given Note, though made upon whatſoever different Bodies, (as String, Bell, Pipe, <hi>Larynx,</hi> &amp;c.) are made with Vibrations or Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings of thoſe Bodies, all equal each to other. And whatſoever Tuneable Sound is more acute, is made with Vibrations more ſwift; and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is more grave, is made with more ſlow Vibrations: And this is univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreed upon, as moſt evident to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and will be more manifeſt through the whole Theory.</p>
               <p>And, That the Continuance of the Sound in the ſame Tune, to the laſt, (as may be perceived in Wire-ſtrings, which being once ſtruck will hold their Sound long) depends upon the Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Time of the Vibrations, from
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59863:10"/>the greateſt Range till they come to ceaſe: And this perfectly makes out the following Theory of Conſonancy, and Diſſonancy.</p>
               <p>Some of the Ancient Greek Authors of Muſick, took notice of Vibrations: And that the ſwifter Vibrations cauſed acuter, and the ſlower, graver Tones. And that the Mixture, or not Mixture of Motions creating ſeveral Intervals of Tune, was the Reaſon of their being concord or diſcord. And likewiſe, they found out the ſeveral Lengths of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nochord, proportioned to the ſeveral Intervals of Harmonick Sounds: But they did not make out the Equality of Meaſure of Time of the Vibrations laſt ſpoken of, neither could be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to anſwer ſuch Objections, as might be made againſt the Continuity of the ſameneſs of Tune, during the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the Sound of a String, or a Bell, after it is ſtruck. Neither did any of them offer any Reaſons for the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59863:10"/>Proportions aſſigned, only it is ſaid, that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> found them out by Chance.</p>
               <p>But now, Theſe (ſince the Acute <hi>Galileo</hi> hath obſerved, and diſcovered the Nature of <hi>Pendulums</hi>) are eaſie to be explained, which I ſhall do, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing ſome Conſideration of the Properties of the Motions of a <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulum.</hi>
               </p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Hang a Plumbet C on a String or Wire, fixed at O. Bear C to A: Then let it range freely, and it will move toward B, and from thence ſwing back towards A. The Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from A to B, I call the Courſe, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59863:11"/>back from B to A, the Recourſe of the <hi>Pendulum,</hi> making almoſt a Semi-Circle, of which O is the Centre. Then ſuffering the <hi>Pendulum</hi> to move of it ſelf forwards and backwards, the Range of it will at every Courſe and Recourſe abate, and diminiſh by degrees, till it come to reſt perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar at OC.</p>
               <p>Now that which <hi>Galileo</hi> firſt obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, was, that all the Courſes and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of the <hi>Pendulum,</hi> from the greateſt Range through all Degrees till it came to reſt, were made in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Spaces of Time. That is, <hi>e. g.</hi> The Range between A and B, is made in the ſame Space of Time, with the Range between D and E, the Plumbet moving ſwifter between A and B, the greater Space; and ſlower between D and E, the leſſer; in ſuch Proportions, that the Motions between the Terms AB and DE, are performed in Equal ſpace of time.</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:59863:11"/>
               <p> And here it is to be noted, that where-ever in this Treatiſe, the ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or ſlowneſs of Vibrations is ſpoke of, it muſt be always underſtood of the Frequency of their Courſes and Recourſes, and not of the Motion by which it paſſeth from one ſide to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. For it is true, that the ſame <hi>Pendulum</hi> under the ſame Velocity of Returns, moves from one ſide to the other, with greater or leſs Velocity, according as the Range is greater or leſs.</p>
               <p>And hence it is, that the Librations of a <hi>Pendulum</hi> are become ſo excellent, and uſefull a Meaſure of Time; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when a ſecond Obſervation is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that, as you ſhorten the <hi>Pendulum,</hi> by bringing C nearer to its Centre O, ſo the Librations will be made propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably in a ſhorter Meaſure of Time, and the Contrary if you lengthen it. And this is found to hold in a Duplicate Proportion of Length to Velocity.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59863:12"/>That is, the Length quadrupled, will ſubduple the Velocity of Vibrations: And the Length ſubquadrupled, will duple the Vibrations, for the Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on holds reciprocally. As you add to the Length of the <hi>Pendulum,</hi> ſo you diminiſh the Frequency of Vibrations, and increaſe them by ſhortning it.</p>
               <p>Now therefore to make the Courſes of a <hi>Pendulum</hi> doubly ſwift, <hi>i. e.</hi> to move twice in the ſame Space of Time, in which it did before move once; you muſt ſubquadruple the Length of it, <hi>i. e.</hi> make the <hi>Pendulum</hi> but a Quarter ſo long as it was before. And to make the Librations doubly ſlow, to paſs once in the Time they did paſs twice; you muſt quadruple the Length; make the <hi>Pendulum</hi> four Times as long as it was before, and ſo on in what Proportion you pleaſe.</p>
               <p>Now to apply this to Muſick, make two <hi>Pendulums,</hi> AB and CD, faſten together the Plumbets B and D, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59863:12"/>Stretch them at Length, (fixing the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters A and C.) Then, being ſtruck, and put into Motion; the Vibrations, which before were Diſtinct, made by AB, and CD, will now be United (as of one Entire String) both backward and forward, between E and F. Which Vibrations (retaining the aforeſaid Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy to a <hi>Pendulum</hi>) will be made in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Spaces of Time, from the firſt to the laſt; <hi>i. e.</hi> from the greateſt Range to the leaſt, until they ceaſe. Now, this being a double <hi>Pendulum,</hi> to Subduple the Swiftneſs of the Vibrations, you do but Double the Length from A to C, which will be Quadruple to AB. The lower Figure is the ſame with that above, only the Plummets taken off.</p>
               <figure>
                  <figDesc>vibrating string patterns</figDesc>
               </figure>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:59863:13"/>
               <p> And here you have the Nature of the String of a Muſical Inſtrument, reſembling a double <hi>Pendulum</hi> moving upon two Centers, the Nut and the Bridge, and vibrating with the greateſt Range in the Middle of its Length; and the Vibrations equal even to the laſt, which muſt make it keep the ſame Tune ſo long as it ſounds. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it doth manifeſtly keep the ſame Tune to the laſt, it follows that the Vibrations are equal; Confirming one another by two of our Senſes: in that we ſee the Vibrations of a <hi>Pendulum</hi> move equally; and we hear the Tune of a String, when it is ſtruck, continue the ſame.</p>
               <p>The Meaſure of Swiftneſs of Vibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the String or Chord, as hath been ſaid, conſtitutes and determines the Tune, as to Acuteneſs and Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Note which it ſounds: And the Lengthning or Shortning of the String, under the ſame Tenſion, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59863:13"/>the Meaſure of the Vibrations which it makes. And thus, Harmony comes under Mathematical Calculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Proportions, of the Length of Chords; of the Meaſure of Time in Vibrations; of the Intervals of tuned Sounds. As the Length of one Chord to another, <hi>Caeteris paribus,</hi> I mean, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſame Matter, Thickneſs and Tenſion; ſo is the Meaſure of the Time of their Vibrations. As the Time of Vibrations of one String to another, ſo is the Interval or Space of Acuteneſs or Gravity of the Tune of that one, to the Tune of the other: And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, as the Length is (<hi>Caeteris pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus</hi>) ſo is the determinate Tune.</p>
               <p>And upon theſe Proportions in the Differences, of Lengths, of Vibrations, and of Acuteneſs and Gravity; I ſhall inſiſt all along this Treatiſe, very large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and particularly, for the full Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of all ſuch ingenious Lovers of Muſick, as ſhall have the Curioſity to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59863:14"/>inquire into the Natural Cauſes of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> which occurr therein, though otherwiſe, to the more learned in Muſick and Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Proportions, all might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed very much ſhorter, and ſtill be more ſhortned by the help of Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols.</p>
               <p>And here we may fix our Foot: Concluding, that what is evident to Sence, of theſe <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> in a Chord, is equally (though not ſo diſcernably) true of the Motions of all other Bodies which render a tuneable Sound, as the Trembling of a Bell or Trumpet, the forming of the <hi>Larynx</hi> in our ſelves, and other Animals, the Throat of Pipes and of thoſe of an Organ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All of them in ſeveral Proportions ſenſibly trembling and impreſſing the like Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulations of the <hi>Medium,</hi> as is done by the ſeveral (more manifeſt) Vibrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Strings or Chords.</p>
               <p>In theſe other Bodies, laſt ſpoken of,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59863:14"/>we manifeſtly ſee Reaſon of the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Swiftneſs of their Vibrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (though we cannot ſo well meaſure them) from their Shape, and other Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents in their Conſtitution; and chiefly from the Proportions of their Magnitudes; the Greater generally vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating ſlower, and the Leſs more ſwiftly, which give the Tunes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. We ſee it in the Greatneſs of a String. A greater and thicker Chord will give a graver and lower Tone than one that is more ſlender, of the ſame Tenſion and Length; but they may be made Uniſon by altering their Length and Tenſion.</p>
               <p>Tenſion is proper to Chords or Strings (except you will account a Drumm for a Muſical Inſtrument, which hath a Tenſion not in Length, but in the whole Surface) as when we wind up, or let down the Strings, <hi>i. e.</hi> give them a greater or leſs Tenſion, in tuning a Viol, Lute, or Harpſichord,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59863:15"/>and is of great Concern, and may be meaſured by hanging Weights on the String to give it Tenſion; but not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily, nor ſo certainly.</p>
               <p>But the Lengths of Chords (becauſe of their Analogy to a <hi>Pendulum</hi>) is chiefly conſidered, in the Diſcovery of the Proportions which belong to Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, it being moſt eaſie to meaſure and deſign the Parts of a Monochord, in relation to the whole String; and therefore all Intervals in Harmony may firſt be deſcribed, and underſtood, by the Proportions of the Length of Strings, and conſequently of their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brations. And it is for that reaſon, that in this Treatiſe of the Grounds of Harmony, Chords come ſo much to be conſidered, rather than other ſounding Bodies, &amp; thoſe, chiefly in their Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Length. It is true, that in Wind-Inſtruments, there is a regard to the Length of Pipes, but they are not ſo well accommodated (as are Chords) to be
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59863:15"/>examined, neither are their Vibrations, nor the Meaſure of themſo manifeſt.</p>
               <p>There are ſome Muſical Sounds, which ſeem to be made, not by Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brations but by Pulſes, as by whisking ſwiftly over ſome Silk or Camblet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuffs, or over the Teeth of a Comb, which render a kind of Tune more Acute or Grave, according to the Swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Motion. Here the Sound is made, not by Vibrations of the ſame Body, but by Percuſſion of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Equal, and Equidiſtant Bodies; as Threads of the Stuff, Teeth of the Comb, paſſing over them with the ſame Velocity as Vibrations are made. It gives the ſame Modification to the Tune, and to the Undulations of the Ayr, as is done by Vibrations of the ſame Meaſure; the Multiplicity of Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes or Percuſſions, anſwering the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of Vibrations. I take this notice of it, becauſe others have done ſo; but I think it to be of no uſe in Muſick.</p>

                  <head>APPENDIX. <hi>Before I conclude this Chapter, it may ſeem needfull, better to confirm the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we have laid, and give the Reader ſome more ample Satisfaction about the Motions and Meaſures of a</hi> Pendulum, <hi>and the Application of it to Harmonick Motion.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>FIrſt then, it is manifeſt to Sence and Experience, and out of all diſpute; that the Courſes and Recour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes return ſooner or later, <hi>i. e.</hi> more or leſs frequently, according as the <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulum</hi> is ſhortned, or made longer. And that the Proportion by which the Frequency increaſeth, is (at leaſt) very near duplicate, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Length of the <hi>Pendulum,</hi> to the Number of Vibrations, but is in reverſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> as the Length increaſeth, ſo the Vibrations decreaſe; and contrary, quadruple the Length, and the Vibrations will be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dupled.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59863:16"/>Subquadruple the Length, and the Vibrations will be dupled. And laſtly, that the Librations, the Courſes and Recourſes of the ſame <hi>Pendulum,</hi> are all made in equal Space of Time, or very near to it from the greateſt Range to the leaſt. Now though the duplicate Proportion aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, and the Equality of Time, are a little called in queſtion, as not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly exact, though very near it; yet in a Monochord we find them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly agree, <hi>viz.</hi> as to the Length, Duple inſtead of Duplicate, becauſe a String faſtened at both Ends is as a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Pendulum,</hi> each of which is quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled by dupling the whole String. And on this duple Proportion, depend all the Rations found in Harmony. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, the Vibrations of a String are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly equal, becauſe they continue to give the ſame Tune.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſing then ſome little Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence may ſometime ſeem to be found
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59863:17"/>in either of theſe Motions of a <hi>Pendulum,</hi> yet the Nearneſs to Truth is enough to ſupport our Foundation, by ſhewing what is intended by Nature, though it ſometimes meet with ſecret Obſtacles in the <hi>Pendulum,</hi> which it does not in a well made String. We may juſtly make ſome Allowance for the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and unſeen Cauſes, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to make ſome little Variations in Trials of Motion upon groſs Matter, and conſequently the like for nicer Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments made upon the <hi>Pendulum.</hi> It is difficult to find exactly the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate Point of the Plumbet, which regulates the Motions of the <hi>Pendulum,</hi> and conſigns its juſt Length. Then obſerve the Varieties which happen through various Sorts of Matter, upon which Experiments are made. <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſennus</hi> tells us, that heavier Weights of the ſame Length move ſlower, ſo that whilſt a Lead Plumbet makes 39 Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brations, Cork or Wood will make at
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59863:17"/>leaſt 40. Again, that a ſtiff <hi>Pendulum</hi> vibrates more frequently, than that which hangs upon a Chord. So that a Barr of Iron, or Staff of Wood ought to be half as long again as the other, to make the Vibrations equal. Yet in each of theſe reſpectively to it ſelf, you will find the duplicate Proportion and Equality of Vibration, or as near as may be. And (as to Equality) though in the Extreams of the Ranges of Librations, <hi>viz.</hi> the Greateſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the Leaſt, there may (from unſeen Cauſes) appear ſome Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, yet there is do diſcernable Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the Time of Vibrations of a <hi>Pendulum</hi> in Ranges, that are near to one another, whether greater or leſs; which is the Caſe of the Ranges of the Vibration of a String being made in a very ſmall Compaſs: And therefore the Librations of a <hi>Pendulum,</hi> limited to a ſmall Difference of Ranges, do well correſpond with the Vibrations of a String.</p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:59863:18"/>
                  <p> As to Strings, the Whole of Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny depends upon this experimented and unqueſtioned Truth, that Diapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is duple to its Uniſon, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Diapente is Seſquialterum, Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſeron Seſquitertium, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet if you happen to divide a faulty String of an Inſtrument, you will not find the Octave juſt in the Middle, nor the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Intervals in their due Proportion, which is no Default in Nature, but in the Matter we apply. A falſe String is that, which is thicker in one Part of its Length, than in another. The thicker Part naturally vibrates ſlower, and ſounds graver; the more ſlender Part vibrates ſwifter, and ſounds more acute. Thus whilſt two Sounds ſo near one another, are at once made upon the ſame String, they make a rough diſcording Jarr, being a hoarſe Tune mixed of both, more or leſs, as the String is more or leſs unequal: And if the thicker Part be next the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59863:18"/>Frets, then the Fret (for example D. F. H. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in a Viol or Lute) will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Tune of the Note too ſharp; and the contrary, if the ſlender Part of the String be next the Frets; becauſe in the former, the thicker Part is ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and the thinner ſounds more of the acuter Part of this unhappy Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: As in the latter, the thicker Part is left to ſound the graver Tune, and thus the Fret will give a wrong Tune, though the Fault be not in the Fret, but in the String; which yet, by an unwary Experimenter, may happen to cauſe the <hi>Sectio Canouis</hi> to be called in queſtion, as well as the Meaſures of a <hi>Pendulum</hi> are diſputed.</p>
                  <p>But all this does not diſprove the Meaſures found out, and aſſigned to Harmonick Intervals, which are veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied upon a true String or Wire as to their Lengths, and as to the Equality of Recourſes in their Vibrations, though <hi>Pendulums</hi> are thought to move ſlower
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59863:19"/>in their leaſt Ranges; yet, as to Strings, in the very ſmall Ranges which they make, (which are much leſs in other Inſtruments, or ſounding Bodies) I need add no more than this, that the Continuance of the ſame Tune to the laſt, after a Chord is ſtruck, and the continued Motion in leſs Vibrations of a ſympathizing String, during the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of greater Vibrations of the String which is ſtruck, do either of them ſufficiently demonſtrate, that thoſe greater or leſs Vibrations, are both made in the ſame Meaſure of Time, according to their Proportions, keeping exact Pace with each other. Otherwiſe; In the former, the Tune would ſenſibly alter, and in the latter, the ſympathizing String could not be continued in its Motion. This was not ſo well concluded, till the late Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of the <hi>Pendulum</hi> gave light to it.</p>
                  <p>There is one thing more which I
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59863:19"/>muſt not omit. That the Motions of a <hi>Pendulum,</hi> may ſeem not ſo proper to explicate the Motions of a String, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſaid Motions depend upon differing Principles, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe of a <hi>Pendulum</hi> upon Gravity; thoſe of a String upon Elaſticity. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore endeavour to ſhew, how the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a <hi>Pendulum,</hi> agree with thoſe of a Spring, and how properly the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Vibrations of a String, is deduced from the Properties of a <hi>Pendulum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Elaſtick power of a Spring, in a Body indued with Elaſticity, ſeems to be nothing elſe, but a natural Propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Endeavour of that Body, forced out of its own Place, or Poſture, to reſtore it ſelf again into its former more eaſie and natural Poſture of Reſt. And this is found in ſeveral Sorts of Bodies, and makes different Caſes, of which I ſhall mention ſome.</p>
                  <p>If the Violence be by Compreſſion,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59863:20"/>forcing a Body into leſs room than it naturally requires; then the Endeavour of Reſtitution, is by Dilatation to gain room enough. Thus Ayr may be compreſſed into a leſs Space, and then will have a great Elaſticity, and ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle to regain its room. Thus, if you ſqueeze a dry Sponge, it will naturally, when you take off the Force, ſpread it ſelf, and fill its former Place. So, if you preſs with your Finger a blown Bladder, it will ſpring and riſe again to its Place. And to this may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the Springs of a Watch, and of a Spiral Wire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, a ſtiff, but pliable Body, faſtened at one End, and drawn aſide at the other, will ſpring back to its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Place; this is the Caſe of Steel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſprings of Locks, Snaf-hances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Branches of Trees, when ſhaken with the Wind, or pulled aſide, return to their former Poſture: As is ſaid of the Palm, <hi>Depreſſa Reſurgo.</hi> And there
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59863:20"/>are innumerable inſtances of this kind, where the Force is by bending, and the Reſtitution by unbending or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning.</p>
                  <p>This kind is reſembled by a <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulum,</hi> or Plummet hanging on a String, whoſe Gravity, like the Spring in thoſe other Bodies, naturally carries it to its place, which here is downward; all heavy Bodies naturally deſcending till they meet with ſome Obſtacle to reſt upon. And the loweſt that the Plummet can deſcend in its Reſtraint by the String, is, when it is near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to the Horizontal Plane GH, and therefore loweſt. Now, if you force the Plummet upward (held at length upon the String) from B to C, and let it go; it will, by a Spontaneous Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, endeavour its Reſtitution to B: but, having nothing to ſtop it but Air, the Impulſe of its own Veloci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will carry it beyond B, towards D;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59863:21"/>and ſo backward and forward, decrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing at every Range, till it come to reſt at B.</p>
                  <figure/>
                  <p>Thus the <hi>Pendulum</hi> and Spring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in Nature, if you conſider the Force againſt them, and their Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Reſtitution.</p>
                  <p>But further, if you take a thin ſtiff <hi>Lamina</hi> of Steel, like a Piece of Two-penny Riband of ſome length, and nail it faſt at one End, (the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of it being free in the Air) then force the other End aſide and let it go; it will make Vibrations backward and forward, perfectly anſwering thoſe of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59863:21"/>a <hi>Pendulum.</hi> And much more, if you contrive it with a little Steel Button at the End of it, both to help the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on when once ſet on foot, and to bear it better againſt the Reſiſtance of the Ayr. There will be no difference between the Vibrations of this Spring, and of a <hi>Pendulum,</hi> which in both, will be alike increaſed or decreaſed in Proportion to their Lengths. The ſame End (<hi>viz.</hi> Reſt) being, in the ſame manner, obtained by Gravity in one, and Elaſticity in the other.</p>
                  <p>Further yet, if you nail the Spring above, and let it hang down perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular, with a heavier Weight at the lower End, and then ſet it on moving, the Vibrations will be continued and carried on both by Gravity and Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticity, the <hi>Pendulum</hi> and the Spring will be moſt friendly joyned to cauſe a ſimple equal Motion of Librations, I mean, an equal Meaſure of Time in the Recourſes; only the Spring an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59863:22"/>to its Strength, may cauſe the Librations tobe ſomewhat ſwifter, as an Addition of Tenſion does to a String continued in the ſame length.</p>
                  <p>I come now to conſider a String of an Inſtrument, which is a Spring faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at both Ends. It acquireth a double Elaſticity. The firſt by Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and the Spring is ſtronger or weaker, according as the Tenſion is greater or leſs. And by how much ſtronger the Spring is, ſo much more frequent are the Vibrations, and by this Tenſion therefore, the Strings of an Inſtrument keeping the ſame length are put in Tune, and this Spring draws length-ways, endeavouring a Relaxation of the Tenſion.</p>
                  <p>But then, <hi>Secondly,</hi> the String being under a ſtated Tenſion, hath another Elaſtick Power ſide-ways, depending upon the former, by which it endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, if it be drawn aſide, to reſtore it ſelf to the eaſieſt Tenſion, in the ſhorteſt, <hi>viz.</hi> ſtreighteſt line.</p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:59863:22"/>
                  <p> In the former Caſe, Tenſion doth the ſame with abatement of length, and affects the String properly as a Spring, in that the String being forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſtretched, as forcibly draws back to regain the remiſs Poſture in which it was before: And bears little Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy with the <hi>Pendulum,</hi> except in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, in their ſpontaneous Motions in order to their Reſtitution.</p>
                  <p>But there is great Correſpondence in the ſecond Caſe, between the Librati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a <hi>Pendulum</hi> and the Vibrations of a String (for ſo, for diſtinctions ſake, I will now call them) in that they are both proportioned to their length, as has been ſhewn; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Elaſticity which moves the String, and Gravity which moves the <hi>Pendulum,</hi> both of them having the ſame Tendency to Reſtitution, and by the ſame Method. As the Declivity of the Motion of a <hi>Pendulum,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the Impulſe of its Gravity is
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59863:23"/>ſtill leſſened in the Arch of its Range from a Semi-Circle, till it come to reſt perpendicular; the Deſcent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of being more down-right at the firſt and greateſt Ranges, and more Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal at the laſt and ſhorteſt Ranges, as may be ſeen in the preceding Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure CI IE EB; ſo the Impulſe of a Spring is ſtill gradually leſſened as the Ranges ſhorten, and as it gains of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation, till it come to be reſtored to reſt in its ſhorteſt Line. And this may be the Cauſe of the Equality of Time of the Librations of a <hi>Pendu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum,</hi> and alſo of the Vibrations of a String. Now, the Proportions of Length, to the Velocity of Vibrations in one, and of Librations in the other, we are ſure of, and find by manifeſt Experience to be quadruple in one, and duple in the other.</p>
                  <p>Now tack two equal <hi>Pendulums</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether (as before) being faſtened at both Ends, take away the Plumbets,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59863:23"/>and you make it a String, retaining ſtill the ſame Properties of Motion, only what was ſaid before to be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Gravity, muſt now be ſaid to be done by Elaſticity. You ſee what an eaſie Step here is out of one into the other, and what Agreement there is between them. The <hi>Phaenomena</hi> are the ſame, but difficultly experimented in a String, where the Vibrations are too ſwift to fall under exact Meaſure; but moſt eaſie in a <hi>Pendulum,</hi> whoſe ſlow Librations may be meaſured at pleaſure, and numbered by diſtant Moments of Time.</p>
                  <p>To bring it nearer, make your Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the String by Gravity, inſtead of ſcrewing it up with a Pegg or Pin: Hang weight upon a Pulley at one End of the String, and as you increaſe the Weight, ſo you do increaſe the Tenſion, and as you increaſe the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſo you increaſe the Velocity of Vibrations. So the Vibrations are
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59863:24"/>proportionably regulated immediately by Tenſion, and mediately by Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity. So that Gravity may claim a ſhare in the Meaſures of theſe Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Motions.</p>
                  <p>But to come ſtill nearer, and home to our purpoſe. Faſten a Gut or Wire-ſtring above, and hang a heavy Weight on it below, as the Weight is more or leſs, ſo will be the Tenſion, and conſequently the Vibrations. But let the ſame Weight continue, and the String will have a ſtated ſetled Tenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Here you have both in one, a <hi>Pendulum,</hi> and the Spring of a String, which reſembles a double <hi>Pendulum:</hi> Draw the Weight aſide, and let it range, and it is properly a <hi>Pendulum,</hi> librating after the Nature of a <hi>Pendu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum.</hi> Again, when the Weight is at reſt, ſtrike the String with a gentle <hi>Plectrum</hi> made of a Quill, on the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part, ſo as not to make the Weight move, and the String will vibrate, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59863:24"/>give its Tune, like other Strings faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at both Ends, as this is alſo, in this Caſe. So you have here both a <hi>Pendulum</hi> and a String, or either, which you pleaſe. And (the Tenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being ſuppoſed to be ſetled under the ſame Weight) the common Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Regulator of the Proportions of them is the Length. And as you alter the Length, ſo proportionably you alter at once the Velocity in the Recourſes of the Vibrations of the String, and of the Librations of the <hi>Pendulum.</hi> And though the Vibrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one be ſo much ſwifter, and more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent than the Librations, yet the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are altered alike. If you ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the Length of the String, then the Vibrations will be dupled. And if you ſubquadruple it, then the Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will be alſo dupled, allowing for ſo much of the Body of the Weight as muſt be taken in, to determine the Length of the <hi>Pendulum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:59863:25"/>
                  <p> The Vibrations are altered in duple Proportion to the Librations, becauſe (as hath been ſhewn) the String is as a double <hi>Pendulum,</hi> either one of which ſuppoſed <hi>Pendulums</hi> is but half ſo long as the String, and is quadrupled by dupling the whole String. Still there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Proportion of their Alterations holds ſo certainly and regularly with the Proportion of every Change of their common Length, that, if you have the Comparative Ration of either of theſe two, <hi>viz.</hi> Vibrations or Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the Length, you have them both: The increaſe of the Velocity of Librations being ſubduple to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the Velocity of Vibrations. And thus the Motions of a <hi>Pendulum</hi> do fully and properly diſcover to us, the Motions of a String, by the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Correſpondence of their Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Nature. The <hi>Pendulum's</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gravity, and the Strings of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſticity bearing ſo certain Proportions
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59863:25"/>according to Length, that the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Harmony, may be very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly made out, and moſt eaſily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, as explained by the <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulum.</hi> And we find, that in all Ages, this part of Harmony was never ſo clearly underſtood, as ſince the late Diſcoveries about the <hi>Pendulum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And I chuſe to make this Illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the <hi>Pendulum,</hi> becauſe it is ſo eaſie for Experiment, and for our Comprehenſion; and the Elaſtick Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſo difficult.</p>
                  <p>Having ſeen the Origine of Tunea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or Harmonick Sounds, and of their Difference in reſpect of Acuteneſs and Gravity: It is next to be conſidered, how they come to be affected with Conſonancy and Diſſonancy, and what theſe are.</p>

               </head>
               <p>COnſonancy and Diſſonancy are the Reſult of the Agreement, mixture or uniting (or the contrary) of the undulated Motions of the Ayr or <hi>Medium,</hi> cauſed by the Vibrations by which the Sounds of diſtinct Tunes are made. And thoſe are more or leſs capable of ſuch Mixture or Co-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidence according to the Proportion of the Meaſures of Velocity in which they are made, <hi>i.e.</hi> according as they are more or leſs commenſurate. This I might well ſet down as a <hi>Poſtulatum.</hi> But I ſhall by ſeveral Inſtances indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to illuſtrate the undulating Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Undulations of the Ayr; and confirm what is ſaid of their Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Diſagreements. And firſt
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59863:26"/>the Undulations, by ſomewhat we ſee in other Liquids.</p>
               <p>Let a Stone drop into the Middle of a ſmall Pond of ſtanding Water when it is quiet, you ſhall ſee a Motion forthwith impreſſed upon the Water, paſſing and dilating from that Center where the Stone fell, in circular Waves one within another, ſtill propagated from the Center, ſpreading till they reach and daſh againſt the Banks, and then returning, if the force of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be ſufficient, and meeting thoſe inner Circles which purſue the ſame Courſe, without giving them any Check.</p>
               <p>And if you drop a Stone in another place, from that Centre will likewiſe ſpread round Waves; which meeting the other, will quietly paſs them, each moving forwards in its own proper Figure.</p>
               <p>The like is better experimented in Quick-ſilver, which being a more
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59863:27"/>denſe Body, continues its Motions longer, and may be placed nearer your Eye. If you try it in a pretty large round Veſſel, ſuppoſe of a foot Diameter, the Waves will keep their own Motion forward and backward, and quietly paſs by one another as they meet. Something of this may be ſeen in a long narrow Paſſage, where there is not room to advance in Circles.</p>
               <p>Make a wooden Trough or long Box, ſuppoſe of two Inches broad, and two deep, and twenty long. Fill it three Quarters or half full of Quick-ſilver, and place it Horizontally, when it is at quiet, give it with your Finger a little patt at one End, and it will impreſs a Motion of a ridgid Wave acroſs, which will paſs on to the other End, and daſhing againſt it, return in the ſame Manner, and daſh againſt the hether End, and go back again, and thus backward and forward, till
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59863:27"/>the Motion ceaſe. Now if after you have ſet this Motion on foot, you cauſe ſuch another, you ſhall ſee each Wave keep its regular Courſe; and when they meet one another, paſs on without any Reluctancy.</p>
               <p>I do not ſay theſe Experiments are full to my purpoſe, becauſe theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon ſingle Bodies, are not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to expreſs the Diſagreements of Diſproportionate Motions cauſed by different Vibrations of different ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bodies; but theſe may ſerve to illuſtrate thoſe inviſible Undulations of Ayr. And how a Voice reflected by the Walls of a Room, or by Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho being of adequate Vibrations, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns from the Wall, and meets the commenſurate Undulations paſſing forwards, without hindring one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>But there are Inſtances which fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirm the Reaſons of Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy and Diſſonancy, by the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59863:28"/>agreeing or diſagreeing Meaſures of Motions already ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>It hath been a common Practice to imitate a Tabour and Pipe upon an Organ. Sound together two diſcord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Keys (the baſe Keys will ſhew it beſt, becauſe their Vibrations are ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) let them, for Example, be Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mut with Gamut ſharp, or F Faut ſharp, or all three together. Though theſe of themſelves ſhould be exceeding ſmooth and well voyced Pipes; yet, when ſtruck together, there will be ſuch a Battel in the Ayr between their diſproportioned Motions, ſuch a Clat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Thumping, that it will be like the beating of a Drum, while a Jigg is played to it with the other hand. If you ceaſe this, and ſound a full Cloſe of Concords, it will appear ſurprizingly ſmooth and ſweet, which ſhews how Diſcords well placed, ſet off Concords in Compoſition. But I bring this Inſtance to ſhew, how ſtrong
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59863:28"/>and vehement theſe undulating Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are, and how they correſpond with the Vibrations by which they are made.</p>
               <p>It may be worth the while, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late an Experiment upon which I hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened. Being in an Arched ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Room near a ſhrill Bell of a Houſe Clock, when the Alarm ſtruck, I whiſtled to it, which I did with eaſe in the ſame Tune with the Bell, but, indeavouring to whiſtle a Note higher or lower, the Sound of the Bell and its croſs Motions were ſo predominant, that my Breath and Lips were check'd ſo, that I could not whiſtle at all, nor make any Sound of it in that diſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Tune. After, I ſounded a ſhrill whiſtling Pipe, which was out of tune to the Bell, and their Motions ſo claſhed, that they ſeemed to ſound like ſwitching one another in the Ayr.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Galileo,</hi> from this Doctrine of <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulums,</hi> eaſily and naturally explains
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59863:29"/>the ſo much admired ſympathy of Conſonant ſtrings; one (though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touch'd) moving when the other is ſtruck. It is perceptible in Strings of the ſame, or another Inſtrument, by trembling ſo as to ſhake off a Straw laid upon the other String: But in the ſame Inſtrument, it may be made ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry viſible, as in a Baſs-viol. Strike one of the lower Strings with the Bow, hard and ſtrong, and if any of the other Strings be Uniſon or Octave to it, you ſhall plainly ſee it vibrate, and continue to doe ſo, as long as you continue the Stroke of your Bow, and, all the while, the other Strings which are diſſonant, reſt quiet.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon hereof is this. When you ſtrike your String, the Progreſſive ſound of it ſtrikes and ſtarts all the other Strings, and every of them makes a Movement in its own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Vibration. The Conſonant ſtring, keeping meaſure in its Vibrations with
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59863:29"/>thoſe of the ſounding String hath its Motion continued, and propagated by continual agreeing Pulſes or Strokes of the other. Whereas the Remainder of the Diſſonant ſtrings having no help, but being checked by the croſs Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſounding String, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to remain ſtill and quiet. Like as, if you ſtand before a <hi>Pendulum,</hi> and blow gently upon it as it paſſeth from you, and ſo again in its next Courſes keeping exact time with it, it is moſt eaſily continued in its Motion. But if you blow irregularly in Meaſures different from the Meaſure of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Pendulum,</hi> and ſo moſt frequently blow againſt it, the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it will be ſo checked, that it muſt quickly ceaſe.</p>
               <p>And here we may take notice, (as hath been hinted before) that this alſo confirms the aforeſaid Equality of the Time of Vibrations to the laſt, for that the ſmall and weak Vibrations of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59863:30"/>the ſympathizing String are regulated and continued by the Pulſes of the greater and ſtronger Vibrations of the ſounding String, which proves, that notwithſtanding that Diſparity of Range, they are commenſurate in the Time of their Motion.</p>
               <p>This Experiment is ancient: I find it in <hi>Ariſtides Quintilianus</hi> a Greek Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, who is ſuppoſed to have been contemporary with <hi>Plutarch.</hi> But the Reaſon of it deduced from the <hi>Pendu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum,</hi> is new, and firſt diſcovered by <hi>Galileo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is an ordinary Trial, to find out the Tune of a Beer-glaſs without ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it, by holding it near your Mouth, and humming loud to it, in ſeveral ſingle Tunes, and when you at laſt hitt upon the Tune of the Glaſs, it will tremble and Eccho to you. Which ſhews the Conſent and Uniformity of Vibrations of the ſame Tune, though in ſeveral Bodies.</p>

               <p> To cloſe this Chapter. I may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that Conſonancy is the Paſſage of ſeveral Tuneable ſounds through the <hi>Medium,</hi> frequently mixing and uniting in their undulated Motions, cauſed by the well proportioned com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurate Vibrations of the ſonorous Bodies, and conſequently arriving ſmooth, and ſweet, and pleaſant to the Ear. On the contrary, Diſſonan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is from diſproportionate Motions of Sounds, not mixing, but jarring and claſhing as they paſs, and arriving to the Ear Harſh, and Grating, and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive. And this, in the next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhall be more amply explained.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>Of Concords.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>COncords are Harmonic ſounds, which being joyned pleaſe and delight the Ear; and Diſcords the Contrary. So that it is indeed the Judgment of the Ear that determines which are Concords and which are Diſcords. And to that we muſt firſt reſort to find out their Number. And then we may after ſearch and examine how the natural Production of thoſe Sounds, diſpoſeth them to be pleaſing or unpleaſant. Like as the Palate is abſolute Judge of Taſts, what is ſweet, and what is bitter, or ſowr, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though there may be alſo found out ſome natural Cauſes of thoſe Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. But the Ear being entertained with Motions which fall under exact Demonſtrations of their Meaſures, the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59863:31"/>Doctrine hereof is capable of being more accurately diſcovered.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, (ſetting aſide the Uniſon Concord, which is no Space or Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, but an Identity of Tune) the Ear allows and approves theſe following Intervals, and only theſe for Concords to any given Note, <hi>viz.</hi> the Octave or Eighth, the Fifth, then the Fourth, (though by later Maſters of Muſick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded from his Place) then the Third <hi>Major,</hi> the Third <hi>Minor,</hi> the Sixth <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor,</hi> and the Sixth <hi>Minor.</hi> And alſo ſuch, as in the Compaſs of any Voice or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument beyond the Octave, may be compounded of theſe, for ſuch thoſe are, I mean compounded, and only the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Seven are ſimple Concords; not but that they may ſeem to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, <hi>viz.</hi> the greater of the leſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in an Octave, and therefore may be called Syſtems, but they are Originals. Whereas beyond an Octave, all is but Repetition of theſe in Compound with
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59863:32"/>the Eighth, as a Tenth is an Eighth and a Third; a Twelfth is an Eighth and a Fifth; a Fifteenth is Diſdiapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>i.e.</hi> two Octaves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding this Diſtinction of Original and Compound Concords; and, tho' theſe compounded Concords are found, and diſcerned by their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitude to the Original Concords com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the Syſtem of Diapaſon; (as a Tenth aſcending is an Octave above the Third, or a Third above the Octave; a Twelfth is an Octave to the Fifth, or a Fifth to the Eighth, a Fifteenth is an Eighth above the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tave, <hi>i.e.</hi> Diſdiapaſon two Eighths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) yet they muſt be own'd, and are to be eſteemed good and true Concords, and equally uſefull in Melody, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in that of Conſort.</p>
               <p>The Syſtem of an Eighth, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeven Intervals, or Spaces, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and eight Notes reckoned inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, as expreſſed by eight Chords,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59863:32"/>is called Diapaſon, <hi>i. e.</hi> a Syſtem of all intermediate Concords, which were anciently reputed to be only the Fifth and the Fourth, and it comprehends them both, as being compounded of them both: And now, that the Thirds and Sixths are admitted for Concords, the Eighth contains them alſo: <hi>Viz.</hi> a Third <hi>Major</hi> and Sixth <hi>Minor,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain a Third <hi>Minor</hi> and Sixth <hi>Major.</hi> The Octave being but a Replication of the Uniſon, or given Note below it, and the ſame, as it were in Minuture, it cloſeth and terminates the firſt perfect Syſtem, and the next Octave above <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> aſcends by the ſame Intervals, and i<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> in like manner compounded of them, and ſo on, as far as you can proceed upwards or downwards with Voices or Inſtruments, as may be ſeen in an Organ, or Harpſichord. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt juſtly judged by the Ear, to be the Chief of all Concords, and is the only Conſonant Syſtem, which
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59863:33"/>being added to it ſelf, ſtill makes Concords.</p>
               <p>And to it all other Concords agree, and are Conſonant, though they do not all agree to each other; nor any of them make a Concord if added to it ſelf, and the Complement or Reſidue of any Concord to Diapaſon, is alſo Concord.</p>
               <p>The next in Dignity is the Fifth, then the Fourth, Third <hi>Major,</hi> Third <hi>Minor,</hi> Sixth <hi>Major,</hi> and laſtly Sixth <hi>Minor;</hi> all taken by Aſcent from the Uniſon or given Note.</p>
               <p>By Uniſon is meant, ſometimes the Habitude or Ration of Equality of two Notes compared together, being of the very ſame Tune. Sometimes (as here) for the given ſingle Note to which the Diſtance, or the Rations of other Intervals are compared. As, if we conſider the Relations to <hi>Gamut,</hi> to which <hi>A re</hi> is a Tone or Second, <hi>B mi</hi> a Third, C a Fourth, D a Fifth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:59863:33"/>We call <hi>Gamut</hi> the Uniſon, for want of a more proper Word. Thus <hi>C fa ut,</hi> or any other Note to which other Intervals are taken, may be called the Uniſon.</p>
               <p>And the Reader may eaſily diſcern, in which Senſe it is taken all along by the Coherence of the Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>I come now to conſider the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reaſons, why Concords pleaſe the Ear, by examining the Motions by which all Concords are made, which having been generally alledged in the beginning of the third Chapter, ſhall now more particularly be diſcuſſed.</p>
               <p>And here I hope the Reader will pardon ſome Repetition in a Subject, that ſtands in need of all Light that may be, if, for his eaſie and more ſteady Progreſs, before I proceed, I call him back to a Review and brief Summary of ſome of thoſe Notions, which have been premis'd and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered more at large. I have ſhewed,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:59863:34"/> 1. That Harmonick Sound or Tune is made by equal Vibrations or Tremblings of a Body fitly conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That thoſe Vibrations make their Courſes and Recourſes in the ſame Meaſure of Time; from the greateſt Range to the leſſer, till they come to reſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That thoſe Vibrations are under a certain Meaſure of Frequency of Courſes and Recourſes in a given Space of Time.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That if the Vibrations be more frequent, the Tune will be proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably more Acute: if leſs frequent, more Grave.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That the Librations of a <hi>Pendu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi> become doubly frequent, if the <hi>Pendulum</hi> be made four times ſhorter; and twice flower, if the <hi>Pendulum</hi> be four times longer.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That a Chord, or String of a Muſical Inſtrument, is, as a double
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59863:34"/>
                  <hi>Pendulum,</hi> or two <hi>Pendulums</hi> tacked together at length, and therefore hath the ſame Effects by dupling; as a <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulum</hi> by quadrupling, <hi>i. e.</hi> by du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling the Length of the Chord, the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brations will be ſubdupled, <hi>i. e.</hi> be half ſo many in a given Time. And by ſubdupling the Length of the Chord, the Vibrations will be dupled, and proportionably ſo in all other Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Length, the Vibrations bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Reciprocal proportion to the Length.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That theſe Vibrations impreſs a Motion of Undulation or Trembling in the <hi>Medium</hi> (as far as the Motion extends) of the ſame Meaſure with the Vibrations.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That if the Motions made by different Chords be ſo commenſurate, that they mix and unite; bear the ſame Courſe either altogether, or alternate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or frequently: Then the Sounds of thoſe different Chords, thus mixing,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59863:35"/>will calmly paſs the <hi>Medium,</hi> and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at the Ear as one Sound, or near the ſame, and ſo will ſmoothly and evenly ſtrike the Ear with Pleaſure, and this is Conſonancy, and from the want of ſuch Mixture is Diſſonancy. I may add, that as the more frequent Mixture or Coincidence of Vibrations, render the Concords generally ſo much the more perfect: So, the leſs there is of Mixture, the greater and more harſh will be the Diſcord.</p>
               <p>From the Premiſſes, it will be eaſie to comprehend the natural Reaſon, why the Ear is delighted with thoſe forenamed Concords: and that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they all unite in their Motions often, and at the leaſt at every ſixth Courſe of Vibration, which appears from the Rations by which they are conſtituted, which are all contained within that Number, and all Rations contained within that Space of Six, make Concords, becauſe the Mixture
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59863:35"/>of their Motions is anſwerable to the Ration of them, and are made at or before every Sixth Courſe. This will appear if we examine their Motions. Firſt, how and why the Uniſons agree ſo perfectly; and then finding the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of an Octave, and fixing that, all the reſt will follow.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe, ſtrike a Chord of a ſounding Inſtrument, and at the ſame Time, another Chord ſuppoſed to be in all reſpects Equal, <hi>i. e.</hi> in Length, Matter, Thickneſs, and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Here then, both the Strings give their Sound; each Sound is a certain Tune; each Tune is made by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Meaſure of Vibrations: the ſame Vibrations are impreſſed upon, and carried every way along the <hi>Medium,</hi> in Undulations of the ſame Meaſure with them, until the Sounds arrive at the Ear. Now the Chords being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be equal in all reſpects; it follows, that their Vibrations muſt be
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59863:36"/>alſo equal, and conſequently move in the ſame Meaſure, joyning and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in every Courſe and Recourſe, and keeping ſtill the ſame Equality, and Mixture of Motions of the String, and in the <hi>Medium.</hi> Therefore the Habitude of theſe two Strings is called Uniſon, and is ſo perfectly Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that it is an Identity of Tune, there being no Interval or Space be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. And the Ear can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly judge, whether the Sound be made by two Strings, or by one.</p>
               <p>But Conſonancy is more properly conſidered, as an Interval, or Space between Tones of different Acuteneſs or Gravity. And amongſt them, the moſt perfect is that which comes near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to Uniſon, (I do not mean betwixt which there is the leaſt Difference of Interval: but, in whoſe Motions there is the greateſt Mixture and Agreement next to Uniſon.) The Motions of two Uniſons are in Ration of 1 to 1, or
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59863:36"/>of Equality. The next Ration in whole Numbers is 2 to 1, Duple. Divide a Monochord in two Equal parts, half the Length compared to the whole, being in Subduple Ration, will make double Vibrations, making two Recourſes in the ſame time that the other makes one, and ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and mixing alternately, <hi>i. e.</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry other Motion. Then comparing the Sounds of theſe two, and the half will be found to ſound an Octave to the whole Chord. Now the Octave (aſcending from the Uniſon) being thus found and fixed to be in duple Proportion of Vibrations, and ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Length; conſequently the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions of all other Intervals are eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found out.</p>
               <p>They are found out by reſolving or dividing the Octave into the mean Rations which are contained in it. <hi>Euclid,</hi> in his <hi>Sectio Canonis, Theorem.</hi> 6. gives two Demonſtrations to prove,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59863:37"/>that Duple Ration contains, and is compoſed of the two next Rations, <hi>viz. Seſquialtera</hi> and <hi>Seſquitertia.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an Octave which is in Duple Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion 2 to 1 is divided into, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of a Fifth, whoſe Ration is found to be <hi>Seſquialtera</hi> 3 to 2; and a Fourth, whoſe Ration is <hi>Seſquitertia</hi> 4 to 3. In like manner, <hi>Seſquialtera</hi> is compoſed of <hi>Seſquiquarta</hi> and <hi>Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiquinta.</hi> That is, a Fifth 3 to 2 may be divided into a Third <hi>Major</hi> 5 to 4, and a Third <hi>Minor</hi> 6 to 5; <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is an eaſie way to take a view of the Mean Rations, which may be contained in any Ration gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, by transferring the Prime or Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Numbers of the given Ration in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to greater Numbers of the ſame Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as 2 to 1 into 4 to 2, or 6 to 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which have the ſame Ration of Duple. Again, 3 to 2 into 6 to 4, which is ſtill <hi>Seſquialtera.</hi> Now in 4 to 2. the Mediety is 3. So that
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59863:37"/>4 to 3 and 3 to 2 are comprehended in 4 to 2; that is, a Fourth and a Fifth are comprehended in an Eighth. In 6 to 4 the Mediety is 5, ſo 6 to 4 contains 6 to 5 and 5 to 4; <hi>i. e.</hi> a Fifth contains the 2 Thirds. Let 6 to 3 be the Octave, and it contains 6 to 5 Third <hi>leſs,</hi> 5 to 4 Third <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor,</hi> and 4 to 3, a Fourth, and hath two Medieties, 5 and 4. Of this I ſhall ſay more in the next Chapter.</p>
               <p>Theſe Rations expreſs the Difference of Length in ſeveral Strings which make the Concords; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Difference of their Vibrations. Take two Strings A B, in all other Reſpects equal, and compare their Lengths, which if equal, make Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or the ſame Tune. If A be dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in Length to B, <hi>i. e.</hi> 2 to 1, the Vibrations of B will be duple to thoſe of A, and unite alternately, <hi>viz.</hi> at every Courſe, croſſing at the Recourſe, and give the Sound of an Octave to A.</p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:59863:38"/>
               <p> If the Length of A be to that of B as 3 to 2, and conſequently the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brations as 2 to 3, their Sounds will conſort in a Fifth, and their Motions unite after every ſecond Recourſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> at every other or third Courſe.</p>
               <p>If A to B, be as 4 to 3, they ſound a Fourth, their Motions uniting after every third Recourſe, <hi>viz.</hi> at every fourth Courſe.</p>
               <p>If A to B, be as 5 to 4, they ſound a Ditone, or third <hi>Major,</hi> and unite after every fourth Recourſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fifth Recourſe.</p>
               <p>If A to B, be as 6 to 5, they ſound a Trihemitone, or Third <hi>Minor,</hi> uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting after every fifth Recourſe, at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſixth Courſe.</p>
               <p>Thus by the frequency of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mixed and united, the Harmony of joyned Concords is found ſo very ſweet and pleaſing; the Remoter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo combined by their Relation to other Concords beſides the Uniſon.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59863:38"/>The greater Sixth, 5 to 3, is within the Compaſs of Rations between 1 and 6; but, I confeſs, the leſſer Sixth, 8 to 5, is beyond it: but is the Complement of 6 to 5 to an Octave, and makes a better Concord by its Combinations with the Octave, and Fourth from the Uniſon; having the Relation of a Third <hi>Minor</hi> to One, and of a Third <hi>Major</hi> to the Other, and their Motions uniting accordingly. And the Sixth <hi>Major</hi> hath the ſame Advantage. Of theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations I ſhall have occaſion to ſay ſomewhat more, after I have made the Subject in hand as plain as I can.</p>
               <p>I propoſed the Collating of two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Strings, to expreſs the Conſort which is made by them; but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, theſe Rations are more certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found upon the Meaſures of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nochord, taken, by being applied to the Section of a Canon, or a Rule of the Strings length divided into parts, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion requires: becauſe there is no need
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59863:39"/>ſo often to repeat <hi>Caeteris paribus,</hi> as is when ſeveral Strings are collated. And if you take the Rations as Fractions, it will be more eaſie to meaſure out the given Parts of a Monochord, or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle String extended on an Inſtrument: Thoſe parts of the String divided by a Moveable Bridge or Fret put under, and made to ſound; That Sound, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the Sound of the Whole, will give the Interval ſought after. <hi>Ex. gr.</hi> ½ of the Chord gives an Eighth, ⅔ give a Fifth, ¾ ſound a Fourth, ⅘ ſound a Third <hi>Major,</hi> ⅚ a Third <hi>Minor,</hi> ⅗ a Sixth <hi>Major,</hi> ⅝ a Sixth <hi>Minor:</hi> Now we thus expreſs theſe Concords.</p>

               <p> I ſaid, that all Concords are in Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions within the Number Six; and I may add, that all Rations within the Number Six, are Concords: Of which, take the following Scheme.</p>

               <p>All that are Concords to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, are alſo Concords to the Octave, And all that are Diſcords to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, are Diſcords to the Octave. And ſome of the Intermediate Concords, are Concords one to another; as the two Thirds to the Fifth, and the Fourth to the two Sixths. So that the Uniſon, Third, Fifth, and Octave; or the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſon, Fourth, Sixth, and Octave, may
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59863:40"/>be ſounded together to make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Cloſe of Harmony: I do not mean a Cloſe to Conclude with, for the Plagal is not ſuch; but a compleat Cloſe, as it includes all Concords within the Compaſs of Diapaſon. A Scheme of which I have ſet down at the End of the foregoing Staff of five Lines, which containeth the Notes by which the aforeſaid Concords are expreſſed. The former two which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend from the Uniſon, <hi>Gamut,</hi> by Third <hi>Major</hi> (or <hi>Minor</hi>) and Fifth, up to the Octave; are uſually called Authentick, as relating principally to the Uniſon, and beſt ſatisfying the Ear to reſt upon: The other two, which aſcend by the Fonrth and Sixth <hi>Minor,</hi> (or <hi>Major</hi>) up to the ſame Octave, are called Plagal, as more combining with the Octave, ſeeming to require a more proper baſe Note, <hi>vzi.</hi> an Eighth below the Fourth, and therefore not making a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding Cloſe: And on the continual
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59863:40"/>ſhifting theſe, or often changing them, depends the Variety of Harmony (as far as Conſonancy reacheth, which is but as the Body of Muſick) in all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trapunct chiefly, but indeed in all Kinds of Compoſition. I do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a Sprinkling of Diſcords; nor here medle with Ayr, Meaſure, and Rythmus, which are the Soul and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Muſick, and give it ſo great a commanding Power. The Plagal Moods deſcend by the ſame Intervals, by which the Authentick aſcend; which is by Thirds and Fifths; and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick deſcend the ſame by which the Plagal aſcend, <hi>viz.</hi> by Fourths and Sixths; one chiefly relating to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the other to the Octave.</p>
               <p>But that, for which I deſcribed theſe full Cloſes, was chiefly, to give (as I promis'd) a larger account of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned Combinations of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, which increaſe the Conſonan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of each Note, and make a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59863:41"/>Variegation and Delightfulneſs of the Harmony.</p>
               <p>Caſt your Eye upon the Firſt of them in the Authentick Scale; you will ſee that <hi>B mi</hi> hath 3 Relations of Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nnacy, <hi>viz.</hi> To the Uniſon, or given Note G; to the Fifth, and to the Octave: To the Uniſon as a Third <hi>Minor;</hi> to the Fifth as a Third <hi>Major;</hi> to the Octave a Sixth <hi>Major;</hi> ſo that its Motions joyn after every fifth Recourſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> at every ſixth Courſe, with the Uniſon; every fifth with the Diapente or Fifth; every ſixth Courſe with the Octave. Then conſider the Diapente, <hi>D ſol re;</hi> as a Fifth to the Uniſon, it joyns with it every third Courſe; and as a Fourth to the Octave, they joyn every Fourth Courſe. Then, the Octave with the Uniſon, joyns after every ſecond Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration, <hi>i. e.</hi> at every Courſe.</p>
               <p>Now take a Review of the Variety of Conſonancies in theſe four Notes. Here are mixed together in one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59863:41"/>the Rations of 2 to 1, 3 to 2, 4 to 3, 5 to 4, 6 to 5, 5 to 3. And juſt ſo it is in the other Cloſes, only changing alternately the Sixths.</p>
               <p>You may ſee here, within the Space of three Intervals from the Uniſon, <hi>viz.</hi> 3d, 5th, and 8th; what a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe there is of Conſonant Rations, to Variegate and give (as it were) a pleaſant Purling to the Harmony with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that Space. For now, all this Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety is formed within one Syſtem of Diapaſon, juſtly bearing that Name. But then, think what it will be, when the remote Compounded Concords are joyned to them; as when we make a full Cloſe with both Hands upon an Organ, or Harpſichord, or when the higher Part of a Conſort of Muſick is reconciled to the lower, by the middle Parts; <hi>viz.</hi> the Treble to the Baſe, by the Mean and Tenor: And all this, refreſhed by the Interchangings made between the Plagal and Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59863:42"/>Moods. Add to all this, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Variety of Movement of ſome Parts, through all Spaces, while ſome Part moves ſlowly: And (as in <hi>Fuges</hi>) one part chaſing and purſuing another.</p>
               <p>The whole Reaſon of Conſonancy, being founded upon the Mixture, and Uniting of the Vibrating Motions of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Chords or ſounding Bodies; it is fit, it ſhould here be better explained and confirm'd. That their Mixtures accord to their Rations, it is eaſie to be computed: But it may be repreſented to your Eye.</p>

               <p> Let VV be a Chord, and ſtand for the Uniſon: Let O O be a Chord half ſo long, which will be an Octave to the Uniſon, and the Vibrations double: Then I ſay, they will alternately, <hi>i. e.</hi> at every other Vibration unite: Let from A to B, be the Courſe of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration, and from B to A the Recourſe. Obſerving by the way, that (in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Figures mentioned in this Paragraph and the next, as alſo in the former Diagram of the <hi>Pendulum,</hi> Cap. 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 9.) When I ſay, [from B to A] and, [overtakes V, in A, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] I do there indeavour to expreſs the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter brief and perſpicuous, without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing the Figures with many Lines: and avoiding the Incumbrance of ſo many Cautions, whereby to diſtract the Reader: Yet I muſt always be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to acknowledge the continual Decreaſe of the Range of Vibrations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween A and B, while the Motion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59863:43"/>and by A and B, mean only the Extremities of the Range of all thoſe Vibrations, both the Firſt greateſt, and alſo the Succeſſive leſſened, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually contracted Extremities of their Range. And the following Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration proceeds and holds equally in both, being applied to the Velocity of Recourſes, and not to the Compaſs of their Range, which is not at all here conſidered. Such a kind of Equity, I muſt ſometimes in other parts of this Diſcourſe, beg of the Candid Reader. To proceed therefore, I ſay, whilſt V being ſtruck, makes his Courſe from A to B; O (ſtruck likewiſe) will have his Courſe from A to B, and Recourſe from B to A. Next, whilſt V makes Recourſe from B to A; O is making its Courſe contrary, from A to B, but recourſeth and overtakes V in A, and then they are united in A, and begin their Courſe together. So you ſee, that the Vibrations of Diapaſon unite
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59863:44"/>alternately, joyning at every Courſe of the Uniſon, and croſſing at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
               <p>Thus alſo Diapente or Fifth having the Ration of 3 to 2, unites in like manner at every third Courſe of the Uniſon. Let the Chord DD be Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pente to the Uniſon V; whilſt V cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from A to B, the Chord D courſeth from A to B, and makes half his Recourſe as far as C; <hi>i. e.</hi> 3 to 2. Whilſt V recourſeth from B to A, D paſſeth from C to A, and back from A to B. Whilſt V courſeth again from A to B, D paſſeth from B to A, and back to C. Whilſt V recourſeth from B to A, D paſſeth from C to B, and back to A: And then they unite in A, beginning their Courſes together, at every third Courſe of V. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the reſt of the Concords unite, at the 4th, 5th, 6th Courſe, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Rations, as might this ſame way be ſhewn; but it would take
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59863:44"/>up too much room, and is needleſs; being made evident enough from theſe Examples already given.</p>
               <p>Thus far the Rates and Meaſures of Conſonance lead us on, and give us the true and demonſtrable grounds of Harmony: But ſtill it is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat without Diſcords and Degrees (of which I ſhall treat in another Chapter) intermixed with the Concords, to give them a Foyl, and ſet them off the better. For, (to uſe a homely reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance) That our Food, taken alone, though proper, and wholſome, and natural, may not cloy the Palate, and abate the Appetite; the Cook finds ſuch kinds and varieties of Sawce, as quicken and pleaſe the Palate, and ſharpen the Appetite, though not feed the Stomach: As Vinegar, Muſtard, Pepper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which nouriſh not, nor are taken alone, but carry down the Nouriſhment with better Reliſh, and aſſiſt it in Digeſtion. So the Practical
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59863:45"/>Maſters and Skilful Compoſers make uſe of Diſcords, judiciouſly taken, to reliſh the Conſort, and make the Concords arrive much ſweeter at the Ear, in all ſorts of Deſcant; but moſt frequently in Cadence to a Cloſe. In all which, the chief regard is to be had to what the Ear may expect in the Conduct of the Compoſition, and muſt be performed with Moderation and Judgment; which I now only mention, not intending to treat of Compoſing, which is out of my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign and Sphear, and would be too large; but my deſign is, to make theſe Grounds as plain as I can, thereby to gratifie thoſe, whoſe Philoſophical Learning, without previous Skill in Muſick, will eaſily render them capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of this Theory: And alſo, thoſe Maſters in Practick Muſick, and Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of it, who, though wanting Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, and the Latin and other For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Tongues, to read better Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59863:45"/>yet, by the help of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in Muſick, may attain to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the depth of the Grounds and Reaſons of Harmony, for whoſe ſakes it is done in this Language.</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude this Chapter with ſome Remarks, concerning the Names given to the ſeveral Concords: We call them <hi>Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth,</hi> and <hi>Eighth.</hi> Of theſe, the <hi>Third's</hi> being Two, and <hi>Sixth's</hi> being alſo Two, want better diſtinguiſhing Names. To call them Flat and Sharp Thirds, and Flat and Sharp Sixths is not enough, and lies under a miſtake; I mean, it is not a ſufficient Diſtinction, to call the greater Third and Sixth, Sharp Third, and Sharp Sixth; and the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, Flat. They are ſo, indeed, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending from the Uniſon; but in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending they are contrary; for to the Octave, that greater Sixth is a leſſer Third, and the greater Third is a leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Sixth; which leſſer Third and Sixth
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59863:46"/>cannot well be called Flat, being in a Sharp Key; Flat and Sharp therefore do not well diſtinguiſh them in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. The leſſer Third from the Octave being ſharp, and the greater Sixth flat. So, from the Fifth deſcending by Thirds, if the Firſt be a <hi>Minor</hi> Third, it is Sharp, and the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Major</hi> Third, cannot be ſaid to be Flat.</p>
               <p>The other Diſtinction of them, <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>Major</hi> and <hi>Minor,</hi> is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and does well expreſs which of them we mean. But ſtill, the common and confuſed name of <hi>Third,</hi> if the Diſtinction of <hi>Major</hi> and <hi>Minor</hi> be not always well remembred, is apt to draw young Practitioners, who do not well conſider, into another Errour. I would therefore call the greater Third (as the <hi>Greeks</hi> do) <hi>Ditone, i. e.</hi> of two whole Tones; and the Third <hi>Minor, Trihemitone,</hi> or <hi>Seſquitone,</hi> as conſiſting of three half Tones, (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59863:46"/>of a Tone and half a Tone) And this would avoid the mentioned Errour which I am going to deſcribe.</p>
               <p>It is a Rule in compoſing Conſort Muſick, that it is not lawful to make a Movement of two Uniſons, or two Eights, or two Fifths together; nor of two Fourths, unleſs made good by the addition of Thirds in another Part: But we may move as many Thirds or Sixths together as we pleaſe. Which laſt is falſe, if we keep to the ſame ſort of Thirds and Sixths; for the two Thirds differ one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in like manner as the Fourth dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from the Fifth. For in the ſame manner as the Eighth is divided into a Fifth and Fourth: ſo is a Fifth into a 3d <hi>Major</hi> and 3d <hi>Minor.</hi> Now call them by their right names, and, I ſay, it is not lawful to make a Movement of as many <hi>Ditones,</hi> or of as many <hi>Seſquitones</hi> as you pleaſe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when you take the liberty ſpoken
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59863:47"/>of, under the general names of Thirds, it will be found, that you mix <hi>Ditones</hi> and <hi>Trihemitones,</hi> and ſo are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the aforeſaid Rule; and ſo the Movements of Sixths will be made with mixture and interchanges of 6th <hi>Major</hi> and 6th <hi>Minor,</hi> which is ſafe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
               <p>Yet, I confeſs, there is a little more liberty in moving <hi>Trihemitones</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tones,</hi> as likewiſe, either of the Sixths, than there is in moving Fourths or Fifths; and the Ear will bear it better. Nay, there is neceſſity, in a gradual Movement of Thirds, to make one Movement by two <hi>Trihemitones</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in every Fourth, and Fifth, or Fourth disjunct: That is, twice in <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſon,</hi> or, at leaſt, in two Fifths; as in <hi>Gamut</hi> Key proper. The natural Aſcent will be, <hi>Ut Re Mi Fa Sol La:</hi> Now, to theſe join Thirds in Natural Aſcent, and they will be, <hi>Mi Fa Sol La Fa Sol. Mi Fa Sol La Fa Sol <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s Re Mi Fa Sci La</hi> And thus it will
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59863:47"/>be in other Cliffs, but with ſome va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation, according to the place of the <hi>Hemitone.</hi> Here <hi>Fi <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">

                  </hi> are two <hi>Trihemitones</hi> ſucceeding one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and you cannot well alter them without diſordering the Aſcent, and diſturbing the Harmony; becauſe, where there is a <hi>Hemitone,</hi> the Tone below joined to it, makes a <hi>Trihemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone,</hi> and the next Tone above it, join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it, makes the ſame. Thus you ſee the neceſſity of moving two <hi>Tribe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitones</hi> together, twice in <hi>Diapaſon,</hi> or a 9th, in progreſſion of Thirds, in <hi>Diatonic</hi> Harmony, but you cannot well go further.</p>
               <p>Now, there is Reaſon, why two <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemitones</hi> will better bear it, becauſe of their different Relations, by which one <hi>Trihemitone</hi> is better diſtinguiſhed from another, than one Octave, or one Fifth, or one Fourth from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:59863:48"/>
               <p> In a third <hi>Minor,</hi> which hath two Degrees or Intervals, conſiſting of a Tone and <hi>Hemitone,</hi> the <hi>Hemitone</hi> may be placed either in the lower Space, and then generally is united to his 3d <hi>Major</hi> (which makes the Complement of it to a Fifth) downward, and makes a ſharp Key; or elſe it may be placed in the upper Space, and then generally takes his 3d <hi>Major</hi> above, to make up the 5th upward, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute a Flat Key. And thus a <hi>Tritone</hi> is avoided both ways. I ſay, if the <hi>Hemitone,</hi> in the 3d <hi>Minor</hi> be below, then the 3d <hi>Major</hi> lies below it, and the Air is ſharp. If the <hi>Hemitone</hi> be above, then the 3d <hi>Major</hi> lies above, and the Air is Flat. And thus the two <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> Thirds joined in conſequence of Movement, are differenced in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, conſequent to the place of the <hi>Hemitone;</hi> which variety takes off all Nauſeouſneſs from the Movement, and renders it ſweet and pleaſant.</p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:59863:48"/>
               <p> You cannot ſo well and regularly make a Movement of <hi>Ditones,</hi> though it may be done ſometimes, once or twice, or more, in a Bearing Paſſage (in like manner as you may ſometimes uſe Diſcords) to give, after a little grating, a better Reliſh. The Skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Artiſt may go farther in the uſe of Thirds and Diſcords, than is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily allowed.</p>
               <p>I might enlarge this Chapter, by ſetting down Examples of the Lawful and Unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Movements of Thirds <hi>Major</hi> and <hi>Minor,</hi> and of the Uſe of Diſcords; but, as I ſaid before, my deſign is not to treat of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: However you may caſt your Eye upon theſe following Inſtances; and your own Obſervation from the beſt Maſters will furniſh you with the reſt.</p>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Geometrical,</hi> When three or more Numbers have the ſame Ration; as 2, 4, 8, 16, 32; or Diſcontinued; 2, 4; 64, 128.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly, Harmonical,</hi> (partaking of both the other) When three Numbers are ſo ordered, that there be the ſame Ration of the Greateſt to the Leaſt; as there is of the Difference of the two Greater, to the Difference of the two leſs Numbers. As in theſe three Terms; 3, 4, 6; the Ration of 6 to 3 (being the greateſt and leaſt
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59863:51"/>Terms) is Duple. So is 2, the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of 6 and 4 (the two greater Numbers) to 1. the Difference of 4 and 3 (the two leſs Numbers) Duple alſo. This is Proportion Harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, which Diapaſon 6 to 3, bears to Diapente 6 to 4, and Diateſſaron 4 to 3; as its mean Proportionals.</p>
               <p>Now for the kinds of Rations moſt properly ſo called; <hi>i. e. Geometrical;</hi> firſt obſerve, that in all Rations, the former Term or Number (whether greater or leſs) is always called the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent; and the other following Number, is called the Conſequent. If therefore the Antecedent be the greater Term; then the Ration is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Multiplex, Superparticular, Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partient,</hi> or (what is compounded of theſe) <hi>Multiplex Superparticular,</hi> or <hi>Multiplex Superpartient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Multiplex;</hi> as Duple, 4 to 2; Triple, 6 to 2; Quadruple, 8 to 2.</p>

                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:59863:52"/> 2. <hi>Superparticular;</hi> as 3 to 2, 4 to 3, 5 to 4; Exceeding but by one aliquot part, and in their Radical, or leaſt Numbers, always but by one; and theſe Rations are termed <hi>Seſquial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tera, Seſquitertia,</hi> (or <hi>Supertertia</hi>) <hi>Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiquarta</hi> (or <hi>Superquarta</hi>) <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Note, that Numbers exceeding more than by one, and but by one aliquot part, may yet be <hi>Superparticular,</hi> if they be not expreſſed in their Radical, <hi>i. e.</hi> leaſt Numbers; as 12 to 8 hath the ſame Ration as 3 to 2; <hi>i. e. Superpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular;</hi> though it ſeem not ſo, till it be reduced by the greateſt Common Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor to its Radical Numbers 3 to 2. And the Common Diviſor (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber by which both the Terms may ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally be divided) is often the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the two Numbers; as in 12 to 8, the Difference is 4, which is the Common Diviſor. Divide 12 by 4, the Quotient is 3; Divide 8 by 4, the Quotient 2; ſo the Radical
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59863:52"/>is 3 to 2. Thus alſo 15 to 10, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by the difference 5, gives 3 to 2; yet in 16 to 10, 2 is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Diviſor, and gives 8 to 5; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Superpartient.</hi> But in all <hi>Superpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> Rations, whoſe Terms are thus made larger by being Multiplied: the Difference between the Terms is always the greateſt common Diviſor; as in the foregoing Examples.</p>
               <p>The Third kind of Ration, is <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perpartient,</hi> exceeding by more than One; as 5 to 3, which is called, <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbipartiens Tertias</hi> (or <hi>Tria</hi>) contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 3 and ⅔; 8 to 5, <hi>Supertripartiens Quintas,</hi> 5 and ⅗.</p>
               <p>The Fourth is <hi>Multiplex Superparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,</hi> as 9 to 4, which is Duple, and <hi>Seſquiquarta;</hi> 13 to 4, which is Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and <hi>Seſquiquarta.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Fifth and laſt is <hi>Multiplex Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perpartient,</hi> as 11 to 4; Duple, and <hi>Supertripartiens Quartas.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:59863:53"/>
               <p> When the Antecedent is leſs than the Conſequent; <hi>viz.</hi> when a leſs is compared to a greater; then the ſame Terms ſerve to expreſs the Rations, only prefixing <hi>Sub</hi> to them, as <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multiplex, Subſuperparticular</hi> (or <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>particular</hi>) <hi>Subſuperpartient</hi> (or <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partient</hi>) <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 4 to 2 is <hi>Duple:</hi> 2 to 4 is <hi>Subduple.</hi> 4 to 3 is <hi>Seſquitertia;</hi> 3 to 4 is <hi>Subſeſquitertia;</hi> 5 to 3 is <hi>Superbipartiens Tertias;</hi> 3 to 5 is <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuperbipartiens Tertias, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſhort account of Proportion was neceſſary, becauſe almoſt all the Philoſophy of Harmony conſiſts in Rations, Of the Bodies; Of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and of the Intervals of Sound; by which Harmony is made.</p>
               <p>And in ſearching, ſtating, and comparing the Rations of theſe, there is found ſo much Variety, and Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, and Facility of Calculation, that the Contemplation of them may ſeem not much leſs delightful, than
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59863:53"/>the very hearing the good Muſick it ſelf, which ſprings from this Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. And thoſe who have already an affection for Muſick, cannot but find it improv'd and much inhanſed by this pleaſant recreating Chaſe (as I may call it) in the Large Field of Harmonic Rations and Proportions. where they will find, to their great Pleaſure and Satisfaction, the hidden cauſes of Harmony (hidden to moſt, even to Practitioners themſelves) ſo amply diſcovered and laid plain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them.</p>
               <p>All the Habitudes of Rations to each other, are ſound by Multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Diviſion of their Terms; by which any Ration is Added to, or Subſtracted from another. And there may be uſe of Progreſſion of Rations; or Proportions; and of finding a <hi>Medium,</hi> or <hi>Mediety</hi> between the Terms of any Ration. But the main work is done by Addition, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59863:54"/>of Rations; which, though they are not performed like Addition and Subſtraction of Simple Numbers in Arithmetick; but upon Algebraic Grounds; yet the Praxis is moſt eaſie.</p>
               <p>One Ration is added to another Ration, by Multiplying the two An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent Terms together, <hi>i. e.</hi> the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent of one of the Rations, by the Antecedent of the other (for the more eaſe, they ſhould be reduc'd into their leaſt Numbers or Terms) And then the two Conſequent Terms in like manner. The Ration of the Product of the Antecedents, to that of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Conſequents, is equal to the other Two added or joined together. Thus (for Example) Add the Ration of 8 to 6; <hi>i. e.</hi> (in Radical Numbers) 4 to 3, to the Ration of 12 to 10; <hi>i. e.</hi> 6. to 5; the Product will be 24 and 15; <hi>i. e.</hi> 8 to 5; You may ſet them thus, <note place="margin">

Reduce theſe Products, 24 and 15, to their leaſt Radical Numbers, which is, by dividing as far as you can find a Common Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor to them both (which is here done by 3) and that brings them to the Ration of 8 to 5. By this you ſee, that a Third <hi>Minor,</hi> 6 to 5; added to a Fourth, 4 to 3; makes a Sixth <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> 8 to 5.

And therefore it is uſually done by an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Decuſſation of the Lines.

               <p>Multiplication of Rations is the ſame with their Addition; only it is not wont to be of divers Rations, but of the ſame, being taken twice, thrice, or oftener, as you pleaſe. And as before, in Addition, you added di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Rations by Multiplying them: So here, in Multiplication, you add the ſame Ration to it ſelf, after the ſame manner, <hi>viz.</hi> by Multiplying the Terms of the ſame Ratio by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; <hi>i. e.</hi> the Antecedent by it ſelf, and the Conſequent by it ſelf (which in other words is to Multiply the ſame by 2) and will, in the Operation, be to Square the Ration firſt propounded (or give the Second Ordinal Power; the Ration firſt given being the Firſt Power or Side) And to this Product, if the Simple Ration ſhall again be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded (after the ſame manner as before)
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59863:56"/>the Aggregate will be the Triple of the Ration firſt given; or the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of that Ration Multiply'd by 3; <hi>viz.</hi> the Cube, or Third Ordinal Power. Its <hi>Biquadrate,</hi> or Fourth Power, proceeds from Multiplying it by 4; and ſo ſucceſſively in order as far as you pleaſe you may advance the Powers. For inſtance, The Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Ration 2 to 1, being added to it ſelf, Dupled, or Multiply'd by 2, produceth 4 to 1 (the Ration <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>druple</hi>) and if to this, the firſt again be added (which is equivalent to Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying that ſaid firſt by 3) there will ariſe the Ration <hi>Octuple,</hi> or 8 to 1. Whence the Ration 2 to 1, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken for a Root, its Duple 4 to 1, will be the Square; its Triple 8 to 1, the Cube thereof, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as hath been ſaid above. And to uſe another inſtance; To Duple the Ration of 3 to 2; it muſt be thus Squar'd; 3 by 3 gives 9; 2 by 2 gives 4.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59863:57"/>So the Duple or Square of 3 to 2, is 9 to 4. Again, 9 by 3 is 27; and 4 by 2 is 8: So the Cubic Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of 3 to 2 is 27 to 8. Again, to find the Fourth Power, or <hi>Biquadrate;</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> Squar'd Square) 27 by 3 is 81; 8 by 2 is 16: So 81 to 16 is the Ration of 3 to 2 Quadrupled; as 'tis Dupled by the Square, Tripled by by the Cube, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To apply this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to our preſent purpoſe; 3 to 2 is the Ration of <hi>Diapente,</hi> or a Fifth in Harmony; 9 to 4 is the Ration of twice <hi>Diapente,</hi> or a Ninth (<hi>viz.

               <p> To Divide any Ration, you muſt take the contrary way; And by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting of theſe Roots Reſpectively, Diviſion by their <hi>Indices</hi> will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. <hi>E. gr.</hi> To Divide it by 2, is to take the Square Root of it; by 3, the Cubic Root; by 4, the Biqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dratick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus to divide 9 to 4, by 2; The Square Root of 9, is 3; the Square Root of 4, is 2: Then 3 to 2 is a Ration juſt half ſo much as 9 to 4.</p>
               <p>From hence it will be obvious to any to make this Inference; That Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and Multiplication of Rations are (in this Caſe) one and the ſame thing.

               <p>This I thought fit, on this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to impart to the Reader, having leave ſo to doe from Mr. <hi>Mercator</hi>'s Friend, to whom He preſented the ſaid Manuſcript.</p>
               <p>Here I may advertiſe the Reader; that it is indifferent whether you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the greater Term of an Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic Ration to the leſs, or the leſs to the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:59863:59"/>greater; <hi>i. e.</hi> whether of them you place as Antecedent. <hi>E.gr.</hi> 3 to 2, or 2 to 3. Becauſe in Harmonics, the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Lengths of Chords, and of their Vibrations are reciprocal or Counter-changed. As the Length is increaſed, ſo the Vibrations are in the ſame proportion decreaſed; <hi>&amp; è con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra.</hi> If therefore (as in <hi>Diapente</hi>) the length of the Uniſon String be 3, then the length (<hi>caeteris paribus</hi>) of the String which in aſcent makes <hi>Diapente</hi> to that Uniſon muſt be 2, or 2ds / 3. Thus the Ration of <hi>Diapente</hi> is 2 to 3 in reſpect of the length of it, compared to the length of the Uniſon String.</p>
               <p>Again, the String 2 vibrates thrice, in the ſame time that the String 3 vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brates twice. And thus the Ration of <hi>Diapente</hi> in reſpect of Vibrations is 3 to 2. So that where you find in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, ſometimes the greater Number in the Rations ſet before and made the Antecedent, ſometimes ſet after
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59863:60"/>and made the Conſequent; You muſt underſtand in the former, the Ration of their Vibrations; and in the latter, the Ration of their Lengths; which comes all to one.</p>
               <p>Or you may underſtand the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be compared to <hi>Diapente</hi> above it, and the Ration of Lengths is 3 to 2; of Vibrations 2 to 3: or elſe <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apente</hi> to be compared to the Uniſon, and then the Ration of Lengths is 2 to 3; of Vibrations 3 to 2. This is true in ſingle Rations, or if one Ration be compared to another; then the two Greater Terms muſt be ranked as Antecedents: or otherwiſe, the two Leſs Terms.</p>
               <p>The Difference between Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical and Geometrical Proportion is to be well heeded. An Arithmetical mean Proportion is that which has Equal difference to the Antecedent and Conſequent Terms of thoſe Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to which it is the Mediety; and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:59863:60"/>is found by adding the Terms and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king half the Sum. Thus between 9 and 1, which added together make 10, the Mediety is 5; being Equidif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from 9 and from 1; which Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is 4: As 5 exceeds 1 by 4; ſo likewiſe 9 exceeds 5 by 4. And thus in Arithmetical Progreſſion 2, 4, 6, 8; where the Difference is onely conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there is the ſame Arithmetical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between 2 and 4, 4 and 6, 6 and 8; and between 2 and 6, and 4 and 8. But in Geometrical Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on where is conſidered, not the Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical Difference, but another Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Terms, <hi>viz.</hi> How many times, or how much of a time, or times, one of them doth contain the other (as hath been explained at large in the beginning of this Chapter.) There the Mean Proportional is not the ſame with Arithmetical, but found another way; and Equidifferent Progreſſions make different Rations. The Rations
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59863:61"/>(taking them all in their leaſt Terms) expreſſed by leſs Numbers, being grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than thoſe of greater Numbers, I mean in Proportions <hi>Super-particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, &amp;c.</hi> Where the Antecedents are Greater than the Conſequents: (as on the Contrary, where the Antecedents are Leſs than the Conſequents, the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio</hi>'s of Leſs Numbers are Leſs than the <hi>Ratio</hi>'s of Greater.) The Mediety of 9 to 1, is not now 5, but 3; 3 having the ſame Ration to 1, as 9 has to 3 (as 9 to 3, ſo 3 to 1) <hi>viz.</hi> Triple. And ſo in Progreſſion Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metical, of Terms having the ſame Differences; if conſidered Geometrical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Terms will all be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by unequal Rations. The Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of 2 to 4, 4 to 6, 6 to 8, are Equal; but the Rations are unequal: 2 to 4 is leſs than 4 to 6, and 4 to 6 leſs than 6 to 8. As on the Contrary; 4 to 2, is greater than 6 to 4; and <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to 4 greater than 8 to 6. For 4 to 2
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:59863:61"/>is Duple; 6 to 4 but <hi>Seſquialtera</hi> (one and a half onely, or 2/2) and 8 to 6 is no more than <hi>Seſquitertia,</hi> (one and a Third part, or 4/3) which ſhews a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Inequality of their Rations. In like manner, 6 to 2 is Triple; 8 to 4 is but Duple; and yet their Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Equal. Thus the mean Rations comprehended in any greater Ration divided Arichmetically; <hi>i. e.</hi> by Equal Differences; are unequal to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſidered Geometrically. Thus 2, 3, 4, 5, 6; if you conſider the Numbers, make an Arithmetical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion: But if you conſider the Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thoſe Numbers, as is done in Harmony, then they are Unequal; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one being greater or leſs (according as you proceed by Aſcent or Deſcent) than the next to it. Thus in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, 2 to 3 is the greateſt, being <hi>Diapente;</hi> 3 to 4 the next, <hi>Diateſſaron;</hi> 4 to 5 ſtill leſs, <hi>viz. Ditone;</hi> 5 to 6 the leaſt, being <hi>Seſquitone.</hi> Or, if you deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:59863:62"/>6 to 5 leaſt; 5 to 4 next, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe are the mean Rations compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the Ration of 6 to 2, by which <hi>Diapaſon cum Diapente,</hi> or a 12th, is divided into the aforeſaid Intervals, and meaſured by them: <hi>viz.</hi> as is 6 to 2, (<hi>viz.</hi> Triple.) So is the Aggregate of all the mean Rations within that Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; 6 to 5, 5 to 4, 4 to 3, and 3 to 2. Or 6 to 5, 5 to 2; or 6 to 4, 4 to 2; or 6 to 3, 3 to 2. The Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregates of theſe are Equal to 6 to 2, <hi>viz.</hi> Triple.</p>
               <p>This is premiſed in order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to what was intimated in the foregoing Chapter.</p>
               <p>Taking notice firſt of this procedure, peculiar to Harmonics; <hi>viz.</hi> To make Progreſſion or Diviſion in Arithmetical Proportion in reſpect of the Numbers; but to conſider the things Numbred ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Rations Geometrical. And thus Harmonic proportion, is ſaid to be compounded of Arithmetical and Geometrical.</p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:59863:62"/>
               <p> You may find them all in the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Syſteme of <hi>Diapaſon,</hi> into <hi>Diapente</hi> and <hi>Diateſſaron,</hi> i. e. 5th and 4th; aſcending from the Uniſon.</p>
               <p>If by <hi>Diapente</hi> firſt, Then by 2, 3, 4, Arithmetically: If firſt by <hi>Diateſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> Then by 3, 4, 6, Harmonically. And theſe Rations conſidered Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically, in Relation to Sound; There is likewiſe found Geometrical Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons between the Numbers 6, 3, to 4, 2; and 6, 4, to 3, 2.</p>
               <p>The Antients therefore owning one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 8th, 5th, and 4th, for Simple Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant Intervals; concluded them all within the Numbers of 12, 9, 8, 6, which contained them all: <hi>viz.</hi> 12 to 6, <hi>Diapaſon;</hi> 12 to 8, <hi>Diapente;</hi> 12 to 9, <hi>Diateſſaron;</hi> 9 to 8, <hi>Tone.</hi> And which ſerved to expreſs the three Kinds of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion; <hi>viz.</hi> Harmonical, between 12 to 8, and 8 to 6; Arithmetical, between 12 to 9, and 9 to 6; and Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, between 12 to 9, and 8 to 6;
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59863:63"/>and between 12 to 8, and 9 to 6. It was ſaid therefore, That <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> his Lyre was ſtrung with four Chords, having thoſe Proportions, 6, 8, 9, 12. <hi>Gaſſend.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I intimated that I would here more largely explain that ready and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie way of finding and meaſuring the mean Rations contained in any of thoſe Harmonick Rations given, by transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them out of their Prime or Radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Numbers, into greater Numbers of the ſame Ration. By Dupling (not the Ration, but the Terms of it: ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing the ſame Ration) you will have one Mediety: as 2 to 1 Dupled is 4 to 2; and you have 3 the Mediety. By Tripling you will have two Means; 2 to 1 Tripled is 6 to 3, containing 3 Rations; 6 to 5, 5 to 4, 4 to 3; and ſo ſtill more, the more you multiply it.</p>
               <p>Now obſerve, Firſt, That any Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Multiplex</hi> or <hi>Superpartient</hi> (or by
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59863:63"/>transferring it out of its Radical Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers made like <hi>Superpartient</hi>) contains ſo many <hi>Superparticular</hi> Rations, as there are Units in the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Antecedent and the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent. Thus in 8 to 4 (being 2 to 1 transferred by Quadrupling) the Difference is 4, and it contains 4 <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perparticular</hi> Rations; <hi>viz.</hi> 8 to 7, 7 to 6, 6 to 5, and 5 to 4. Where though the Progreſſion of Numbers is Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metical, yet the Proportions of exceſs are Geometrical and Unequal. The <hi>Superparticular</hi> Rations expreſſed by leſs Numbers, being Greater, as hath been ſaid, than thoſe that conſiſt of Greater Numbers; 5 to 4 is a Greater Ration than 6 to 5, and 6 to 5 Greater than 7 to 6, and 7 to 6 than 8 to 7; as a Fourth part is Greater than a Fifth, and a Fifth Greater than a Sixth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But in this Inſtance, there are two Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions not appertaining to Harmonics; <hi>viz.</hi> 8 to 7, and 7 to 6.</p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:59863:64"/>
               <p> Secondly therefore, you may make unequal Steps, and take none but Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monick Rations, by Selecting Greater and fewer intermediate Rations, tho' ſome of them compoſed of ſeveral <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perparticulars;</hi> provided you do not diſcontinue the Rational Progreſſion, but that you repeat ſtill the laſt Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, making it the next Antecedent. As if you meaſure the Ration of 8 to 4, by 8 to 6, and 6 to 4; or by 8 to 5, and 5 to 4; or by 8 to 6, and 6 to 5, and 5 to 4. In theſe three ways the Rations are all Harmonical, and are reſpectively contained in, and make up the Ration of 8 to 4. Thus you may meaſure, and divide, and compound moſt Harmonick Rations without you Pen.</p>
               <p>To that End, I would have my Reader to be very perfect in the Radical Numbers, which expreſs the Rations of the Seven firſt (or uncompounded) Conſonants: <hi>viz. Diapaſon,</hi> 2 to 1;
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59863:64"/>
                  <hi>Diapente,</hi> 3 to 2; <hi>Diateſſaron,</hi> 4 to 3; <hi>Ditone,</hi> 5 to 4; <hi>Trthemitone,</hi> 6 to 5; <hi>Hexachordon Majus,</hi> 5 to 3; <hi>Hexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chordon Minus,</hi> 8 to 5. And likewiſe of the Degrees in Diatonick Harmony, viz. <hi>Tone Major,</hi> 9 to 8; <hi>Tone Minor,</hi> 10 to 9; <hi>Hemitone Major,</hi> 16 to 15. And the Differences of thoſe Degrees; <hi>Hemitone Greateſt,</hi> 27 to 25; and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitone Minor,</hi> 25 to 24; <hi>Comma,</hi> or <hi>Schiſm,</hi> 81 to 80; <hi>Dieſis Enharmonic,</hi> 128 to 125.</p>
               <p>Of other <hi>Hemitones,</hi> I ſhall treat in the Eighth Chapter.</p>
               <p>Now if you would divide any of the Conſonants into two Parts, you may do it by the Mean, or Mediety of the two Radical Numbers; if they have a Mean: And where they have not (as when their <hi>Ratio</hi>'s are <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>particular</hi>) you need but Duple thoſe Numbers, and you will have a Mean (one or more.) Thus Duple the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Ration of <hi>Diapaſon,</hi> 2 to 1;
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59863:65"/>and you have 4 to 2; and then 3 is the Mean by which it is divided into two Unequal, but Proper and Harmonical parts; <hi>viz.</hi> 4 to 3, and 3 to 2. After this manner <hi>Diapaſon,</hi> 4 to 2; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends 4 to 3, and 3 to 2. So <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pente,</hi> 6 to 4; is 6 to 5, and 5 to 4. <hi>Ditone,</hi> 10 to 8; is 10 to 9, and 9 to 8. So Sixth <hi>Major,</hi> 5 to 3; is 5 to 4, and 4 to 3.</p>
               <p>Though, from what was now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, you may divile any of the Conſonants into intermediate Parts; yet when you divide theſe three fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, <hi>viz.</hi> Sixth <hi>Minor, Diateſſaron,</hi> and <hi>Trihemitone;</hi> you will find that thoſe Parts into which they are divided, are not all ſuch Intervals as are Harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. The Sixth <hi>Minor,</hi> whoſe Ration is 8 to 5, contains in it three Means; <hi>viz.</hi> 8 to 7, 7 to 6, and 6 to 5; the laſt whereof onely is one of the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monick Intervals, of which the Sixth <hi>Minor</hi> conſiſts; <hi>viz. Tribemitone:</hi> and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59863:65"/>to make up the other Interval, <hi>viz. Diateſſaron;</hi> you muſt take the other two, 8 to 7, and 7 to 6; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing added (or, which is the ſame thing, taking the <hi>Ratio</hi> of their two Extream Terms, <hi>That</hi> being the Sum of all the Intermediate ones added) you have 8 to 6, or (in the leaſt Terms) 4 to 3. Again <hi>Diateſſaron,</hi> in Radical Numbers, 4 to 3; being (if thoſe Numbers are dupled) 8 to 6, gives for his Parts, 8 to 7, and 7 to 6; which <hi>Ratio's</hi> agree with no Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals that are Harmonick. Therefore you muſt take the Ration of <hi>Diateſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> in other Terms, which may afford ſuch Harmonick Parts. And to do this, you muſt proceed farther than dupling (or adding it once to it ſelf) for to this Duple you muſt add the firſt Radical Numbers once again (which in effect is the ſame with Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling it at firſt) <hi>viz.</hi> 4 and 3, to 8 and 6; and the Aggregate will be a
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:59863:66"/>new, but Equivalent, Ration of <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſaron;</hi> viz. 12 to 9. And this gives you three Means, 12 to 11, and 11 to 10; both Unharmonical; but, which together are, as was ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the ſame with 12 to 10 (or 6 to 5) <hi>Trihemitone;</hi> and 10 to 9, <hi>Tone Minor:</hi> and are the two Harmonical Intervals of which <hi>Diateſſaron</hi> conſiſts, and which divide it into the two near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Equal Harmonick Parts. Laſtly <hi>Trihemitone,</hi> or Third <hi>Minor,</hi> 6 to 5; or (thoſe Numbers being dupled) 12 to 10, gives 12 to 11, and 11 to 10; which are Unharmonical Rations: but Tripled (after the former manner) 6 to 5 gives 18 to 15; which divides it ſelf (as before) into 18 to 16, <hi>Tone Major;</hi> and 16 to 15, <hi>Hemitone Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus by a little Practice all Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monick Intervals will be moſt eaſily meaſured, by the leſſer Intervals com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized in them. Now, (for exerciſe
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:59863:66"/>ſake) take the Meaſures of a greater Ration: Suppoſe that of 16 to 3 be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as an Harmonick Syſteme. To find what it is, and of what Parts it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts: Firſt find the groſs Parts, and then the more Minute. You will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently judge, that 16 to 8 (being a Part of this Ration) is <hi>Diapaſon;</hi> and 8 to 4 is likewiſe <hi>Diapaſon:</hi> then 16 to 4 is <hi>Diſdiapaſon,</hi> or a Fifteenth; and the remaining 4 to 3, is a Fourth. So then, 16 to 3, is <hi>Diſdiapaſon,</hi> and <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſaron;</hi> i. e. an Eighteenth: 16 to 8, 8 to 4, and 4 to 3.</p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:59863:67"/>
               <p> But to find all the Harmonick Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals within that Ration (for we now conſider Rations as relating to Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) take this Scheme.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>Of Diſcords and Degrees.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>ALL Habitudes of one Chord to another, that are not Concords (ſuch as are before deſcribed) are Diſcords; which are, or may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable, as are the minute Tenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by which one Chord may be made to vary from it ſelf, or from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. But here we are to conſider onely ſuch Diſcords as are uſeful (and in truth neceſſary) to Harmony, or at leaſt relating to it, as are the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences found between Harmonick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals.</p>
               <p>And theſe apt and uſeful Diſcords, are either Simple uncompounded In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals, ſuch as immediately follow one another, aſcending or deſcending
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59863:68"/>in the Scale of Muſic: As <hi>Ut Re Mi. Fa Sol La Fa Sol,</hi> and are called De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees: Or elſe, greater Spaces or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals compounded of Degrees inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or skipping over ſome of them, as all the Concords do, <hi>Ut Mi, Ut Fa, Ut Sol,</hi> &amp;c. And ſuch are the Diſcords of which we now treat, as principally the <hi>Tritone,</hi> Falſe Fifth, and the two Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venths; <hi>Major,</hi> and <hi>Minor,</hi> if they be not rather among the Degrees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For more perſpicuity I ſhall treat of them ſeverally; <hi>viz.</hi> of Degrees, of Diſcords, and of Differences.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>And Firſt of Degrees.</head>
                  <p>Degrees, are uncompounded Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, which are found upon 8 Chords and in 7 Spaces, by which an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Aſcent or Deſcent is made from the <hi>Uniſon</hi> to the <hi>Octave</hi> or <hi>Diapaſon;</hi> and by the ſame progreſſion to as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Octaves</hi> as there may be occaſion.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59863:69"/>Theſe are different, according to the different Kinds of Muſic; <hi>viz. Enhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monic, Chromatic,</hi> and <hi>Diatonic,</hi> and the ſeveral Colours of the two Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: (All which I ſhall more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently explain by and by.) But of theſe now mentioned, the <hi>Diatonic</hi> is the moſt Proper and Natural Way: The other two, if for Curioſities ſake we conſider them only by running the Notes of an <hi>Octave</hi> up or down in theſe Scales, ſeem rather a force up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Nature; yet herein probably might lye the Excellency of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Greeks.</hi> But we now uſe only the <hi>Diatonic</hi> kind, intermixing here and there ſome of the <hi>Chromatic,</hi> (and more rarely ſome of the <hi>Enharmonic:</hi>) And our Excellency ſeems to lye in moſt artificial Compoſing, and joyning ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts in Symphony or Conſort; which they cannot be ſuppoſed to have effected, at leaſt in ſo many Parts as we ordinarily make; becauſe (as is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59863:69"/>affirmed of them) they owned no Concords, beſides Eighth, Fifth, and Fourth, and the Compounds of theſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>F. Kircher</hi> (cited alſo by <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> without any Mark of Diſſent) is of Opinion, That the Anclent <hi>Greeks</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Conſort Muſic, <hi>i. e.</hi> of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent parts at once; but only Solitary, for one ſingle Voice, on Inſtrument. And that <hi>Guido Aretinus</hi> firſt invented and throught in Muſic of Symphony or Conſort both for the one and the other. They applyed Inſtruments to Voice, but how they were managed, He muſt be wiſer than I, that can tell.</p>
                  <p>This way of theirs ſeems to be more proper (by the Elaborate Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity and Nicety of Contrivance of Degrees, and by Meaſures, rather than by Harmonious Conſonancy, and by long ſtudied performance) to make great Impreſſions upon the Fancy, and operate accordingly, as ſome Hiſtories
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59863:70"/>relate: Ours, more Sedately affects the Underſtanding and Judgment from the judicious Contrivance, and happy Compoſition of Melodious Conſort. The One quietly, but powerfully af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the Intellect by true Harmony: The Other, chiefly by the <hi>Rythmus,</hi> violently attacks and hurries the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. In fine, upon the Natural Grounds of Harmony (of which I have hitherto been treating) is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Diatonic</hi> Muſic; but not ſo, or not ſo regularly, the <hi>Chromatic</hi> and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harmonic</hi> kinds. Take this following view of them.</p>
                  <p>The Ancients aſcended from the <hi>Uniſon</hi> to an <hi>Octave</hi> by two Syſtemes of Tetrachords or Fourths. Theſe were either Conjunct, when they began the Second Tetrachord at the Fourth Chord; <hi>viz.</hi> with the laſt Note of the Firſt Tetrachord; and which being ſo joyned, conſtituted but a Seventh: And therefore they aſſumed a <hi>Tone</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:59863:70"/>the <hi>Uniſon</hi> (which they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called <hi>Proſlambanomenos</hi>) to make a full Eighth.</p>
                  <p>Or elſe the two Tetrachords were diſjunct; the Second taking its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the Fifth Chord; there being always a <hi>Tone Major</hi> between the Fourth and Fifth Chords. So, the Degrees were immediately applyed to the 4ths, and by them to the <hi>Octave;</hi> and were different according to the different Kinds of Muſic. In the common <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonic Genus,</hi> the Degrees were <hi>Tone</hi> and <hi>Semitone;</hi> Intervals more Equal and Eaſy, and Natural. In the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Chromatic,</hi> where the Degrees were <hi>Hemitones</hi> and <hi>Trihemitones;</hi> the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of ſome of the Intervals was Greater. But the Greateſt Difference, and conſequently Difficulty, was in the <hi>Enharmonic</hi> Kind, uſing only <hi>Dieſis,</hi> or Quarter of a <hi>Tone,</hi> and <hi>Ditone;</hi> as the Degrees whereby they made the Tetrachord.</p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:59863:71"/>
                  <p> And to conſtitute theſe Degrees, ſome of them, <hi>viz.</hi> the Followers of <hi>Ariſtoxenus,</hi> divided a <hi>Tone Major</hi> into 12 Equal Parts; <hi>i.e.</hi> Suppoſed it ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided: Six of which being the <hi>Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> half of it,) made a Degree of <hi>Chromatic Toniaeum.</hi> And Three of them, or a Quarter called <hi>Dieſis;</hi> a Degree <hi>Enharmonic.</hi> The <hi>Chromatic</hi> Fourth roſe thus, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Firſt Chord to the Second was a <hi>Hemitone;</hi> from the Second to the Third, a <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitone;</hi> from the Third to the Fourth, a <hi>Trihemitone;</hi> or as much as would make up a juſt Fourth. And this laſt Space (in this caſe) was accounted as well as either of the other, but one Degree or undivided Interval. And they called them <hi>Spiſs</hi> Intervals (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) when two of thoſe other Degrees put together, made not ſo great an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val as one of theſe; as, in the <hi>Enhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monic</hi> Tetrachord, two <hi>Dieſes</hi> were leſs than the remaining <hi>Ditone,</hi> and in the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59863:71"/>common <hi>Chromatic,</hi> two <hi>Hemitone</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees were leſs than the remaining <hi>Trihemitone</hi> Degree.</p>
                  <p>Then for the <hi>Enharmonic</hi> Fourth, the firſt Degree was a <hi>Dieſis,</hi> or Quarter of a <hi>Tone;</hi> the Second alſo 3 of thoſe 12 parts, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Dieſis;</hi> the Third a <hi>Ditone;</hi> ſuch as made up a juſt Fourth. And this <hi>Ditone,</hi> (though ſo large a Degree) being conſidered as thus pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced (in the <hi>Enharmonic</hi> Tetrachord) was likewiſe to them but as one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compounded or entire Interval.</p>
                  <p>Theſe were the Degrees <hi>Chromatic,</hi> and <hi>Enharmonic.</hi> Though they alſo might be placed otherwiſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> The greater Degree in theſe may change its place, as the <hi>Hemitone,</hi> (the leſs De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree) doth in the <hi>Diatonic Genus.</hi> And from this change chiefly aroſe the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Moods, <hi>Dorian, Lydian,</hi> &amp;c. From all which, their Muſic no doubt (though it be hard to us to conceive) muſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford extraordinary delight and pleaſure;
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:59863:72"/>if it did bear but a reaſonable Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their infinite Curioſity and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. And as we may ſuppoſe ie to have differed very much from that which now is, and for ſeveral Ages hath been uſed: So conſequently we may look upon it as in a manner loſt to us.</p>
                  <p>In proſecution of my Deſign I am only, or chiefly to inſiſt on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kind of Degrees; which are moſt proper to the Natural Explanation of Harmony; <hi>viz.</hi> the Degrees <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonic;</hi> which are ſo called; not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are all <hi>Tones;</hi> but becauſe moſt of them, as many as can be, are ſuch; <hi>viz.</hi> in every <hi>Diapaſon,</hi> 5 <hi>Tones,</hi> and two <hi>Hemitones.</hi> Upon theſe I ſay I am to inſiſt, as being, of thoſe before mentioned, the moſt Natural and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional.</p>

                  <p>But before we proceed, it may perhaps be a ſatisfaction to the Reader, after what has been ſaid, to have a little better Proſpect of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Greek Muſic, by ſome general Account; not of their whole Doctrine, but of that which relates to our preſent Subject, <hi>viz.</hi> their Degrees, and Scales of Harmony, and Notes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, take out of <hi>Euclid</hi> the Degrees according to the three <hi>Genera;</hi> which were, <hi>Enharmonic, Chromatic,</hi> and <hi>Diatonic;</hi> which Kinds have ſix Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours (as they call'd them.) <hi>Euclid, Introd.

                  <p>The <hi>Enharmonic</hi> Kind had but one Colour; which made up its Tetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chord by theſe Intervals; a <hi>Dieſis</hi> (or Quarter of a <hi>Tone,</hi>) then ſuch another <hi>Dieſis;</hi> and alſo a <hi>Ditone</hi> incompoſit.</p>

                  <p>I ſhall only add a word or two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their Antient uſe of the Words <hi>Diaſtem</hi> and <hi>Syſtem. Diaſtem</hi> ſignifies an Interval or Space; <hi>Syſtem</hi> a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:59863:78"/>or Compoſition of Intervals. So that generally ſpeaking, an <hi>Octave,</hi> or any other <hi>Syſtem,</hi> might be truly called a <hi>Diaſtem,</hi> and very frequently uſed to be ſo called, where there was no occaſion of Diſtinction. Though a <hi>Tone,</hi> or <hi>Hemitone,</hi> could not be called a <hi>Syſtem:</hi> For when they ſpoke ſtrictly, by a <hi>Diaſtem</hi> they underſtood only an Incompoſit Degree, whether <hi>Dieſis, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitone, Tone, Seſquitone,</hi> or <hi>Ditone;</hi> for the two laſt were ſometimes but Degrees, one <hi>Enharmonic,</hi> the other <hi>Chromatic.</hi> By <hi>Syſtem</hi> they meant, a Comprehenſive Interval, compounded of Degrees, or of leſs <hi>Syſtems,</hi> or of both. Thus a <hi>Tone</hi> was a <hi>Diaſtem,</hi> and <hi>Diateſſaron</hi> was a <hi>Syſtem,</hi> compounded of Degrees, or of a 3d. and a Degree. <hi>Diapaſon</hi> was a <hi>Syſtem,</hi> compounded of the leſſer <hi>Syſtems,</hi> 4th, and 5th; or 3d. and 6th; or of a Scale of Degrees: and the Scale of Notes which they uſed, was their Greateſt, or Perfect <hi>Syſtem.</hi> Thus with
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:59863:79"/>them, a 3d. <hi>Major,</hi> and a 3d. <hi>Minor,</hi> in the <hi>Diatonic Genus,</hi> were (properly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) <hi>Syſtems;</hi> the former being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of two <hi>Tones,</hi> and the latter of three <hi>Hemitones,</hi> or a <hi>Tone</hi> and <hi>Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone:</hi> But in the <hi>Enharmonic</hi> Kind, a <hi>Ditone</hi> was not a <hi>Syſtem,</hi> but an Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſit Degree; which, added to two <hi>Die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> made up the <hi>Diateſſaron:</hi> And in the <hi>Chromatic</hi> Kind, a <hi>Trihemitone</hi> was the like; being only an Incompoſit <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem,</hi> and not a <hi>Syſtem.</hi>

                  <p>But to return from this Digreſſion (which is not ſo much to my purpoſe, as to gratify the Reader's Curioſity) and continue our Diſcourſe according to Nature's Guidance, upon the <hi>Diatonic</hi> Degrees. It was ſaid that there are 5 <hi>Tones</hi> and 2 <hi>Hemitones</hi> in every <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſon.</hi> Now the reaſon why there muſt be 2 <hi>Hemitones,</hi> is, becauſe an Eighth is Naturally compoſed of, and divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to 5th. and 4th; and a Fifth is 3 <hi>Tones</hi> and a half; a Fourth 2 <hi>Tones</hi> and a half;
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:59863:79"/>and the Aſcent, by Degrees, muſt paſs by Fourth and Fifth; which are always unchangeable, and keep the ſame Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from <hi>Uniſon;</hi> and a juſt <hi>Tone Major</hi> of 9 to 8 always between them. Therefore the <hi>Diapaſon</hi> has not an Aſcent of 6 <hi>Tones;</hi> but of 5 <hi>Tones</hi> and 2 <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitones,</hi> One <hi>Hemitone</hi> being placed in each Fourth Disjunct; in either of which Fourths, the Degrees may be altered by placing the <hi>Hemitone</hi> in the Firſt, or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, or Third Degree of either. As, <hi>MI, FA, Sol, La. La, MI, FA, Sol. Sol, La, MI, FA.</hi> If this be done in the former <hi>Tetrachord,</hi> then is changed the Second, or Third <hi>Chord;</hi> If in the other Disjunct <hi>Tetrachord,</hi> then the Sixth, or Seventh is changed: The Fourth and Fifth being Stable and Immutable. By them we Naturally divide the <hi>Diapaſon:</hi> The Second, Third, Sixth, and Seventh, are alterable, as <hi>Minor,</hi> and <hi>Major,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the place of the <hi>Hemitone.</hi>

                  <p> In <hi>Diatonic</hi> Muſic, there is but one Sort of <hi>Hemitone</hi> amongſt the Degrees, called <hi>Hemitone Major;</hi> whoſe Ration is 16 to 15: being the Difference, and making a Degree between a <hi>Tone Major,</hi> and Third <hi>Minor;</hi> or between a Third <hi>Major,</hi> and a Fourth.</p>
                  <p>There are two Sorts of <hi>Tones;</hi> viz. <hi>Major,</hi> and <hi>Minor. Tone Major</hi> (9 to 8) being the Difference between a Fourth and Fifth: And <hi>Tone Minor</hi> (10 to 9) which is the Difference between Third <hi>Minor</hi> and Fourth. But both the <hi>Tones</hi> ariſing (as hath been ſaid) out of the Partion of a Third <hi>Major,</hi> in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as 5th. and 4th. do by the Partition of an Eighth: I may (with ſubmiſſion) make the following Remark; wherein, if I be too bold, or be miſtaken, I ſhall beg the Reader's pardon.</p>
                  <p>The Ancient Greek Maſters found out the <hi>Tone</hi> by the Difference of a Fourth and Fifth, ſubſtracting one from the other. But had they found it alſo
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:59863:80"/>(and that more Naturally) by the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a Fifth; firſt into a <hi>Ditone</hi> and <hi>Seſquitone,</hi> and then by the like proper Diviſion of a true <hi>Ditone</hi> (or Third <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor</hi>) into its proper parts; they muſt have found both <hi>Tone Major,</hi> and <hi>Tone Minor. Euclid</hi> reſts ſatisfied, That, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuper-particulare non cadit Medium.</hi> A ſuper-particular Ration cannot have a Mediety; <hi>viz.</hi> in whole Number: which is true in its Radical Numbers. But had he doubled the Radical Terms of a Super-particular, he might have found Mediums moſt Naturally and Uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dividing the Syſtems of Harmony. <hi>Ex. gr.</hi> The Duple Ration 2 to 1, as the Exceſs is but by an Unity; has the Nature of Super-particular: but 2 to 1, the Terms being dupled, is 4 to 2; where 3 is a Medium, which divides it into 4 to 3 (4th.) and 3 to 2 (5th.) Again, 3 to 2, dupling each Term, is 6 to 4; and in the ſame Manner gives the 2 Thirds, <hi>viz.</hi> 6 to 5, (3d. <hi>Minor</hi>)
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59863:81"/>and 5 to 4, (3d. <hi>Major.</hi>) Likewiſe the 3d. <hi>Major,</hi> 5 to 4, dupled as before, 10 to 8, give the 2 <hi>Tones; i. e.</hi> 10 to 9, <hi>Tone Minor,</hi> and 9 to 8, <hi>Tone Major.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it ſeems to be a reaſon why the Antients did not diſcover and uſe the <hi>Tone Minor,</hi> and conſequently not own the <hi>Ditone</hi> for a Concord; becauſe They did not purſue this way of dividing the <hi>Syſtems.</hi> Although <hi>Euclid</hi> had a fair Hint to ſearch further, when he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured the <hi>Diapaſon</hi> by 6 <hi>Tones</hi> [<hi>Major</hi>] and found them to exceed the Interval of <hi>Diapaſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> not uſing <hi>Tone Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> but two Equal <hi>Tones Major,</hi> in a Fourth, were forced to take a leſſer In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval for the <hi>Hemitone;</hi> which is called their <hi>Limma,</hi> or <hi>Pythagorean He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitone;</hi> and, which added to thoſe two <hi>Tones,</hi> makes up the Fourth: it is a <hi>Comma</hi> leſs than <hi>Hemitone Major,</hi> (16 to 15;) and the Ration of it, is 256 to 243.</p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:59863:81"/>
                  <p> Yet we find the later Greek Maſters, <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> to take Notice of <hi>Tone Minor;</hi> and <hi>Ariſtides Quintilianus,</hi> to divide a <hi>Seſquioctave Tone</hi> (9 to 8) by dupling the Terms of the Ration thereof, into 2 <hi>Hemitones;</hi> 18 to 17, and 17 to 16. And thoſe again, by the ſame way, each into two <hi>Dieſes;</hi> 36 to 35, 35 to 34; the Diviſion of 18 to 17, the leſs <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitone:</hi> And 34 to 33, and 33 to 32; the parts of 17 to 16, the greater <hi>Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone.</hi> But yet, none of theſe were the Complement of two <hi>Seſquioctave Tones</hi> to <hi>Diateſſaron:</hi> but another <hi>Hemitone,</hi> whoſe Ratio is about 20 to 19; not exactly, but ſo near it, that the Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is only 1216 to 1215; both which together make the <hi>Limma Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goricum.</hi>

                  <p>There are, you ſee, 3 Degrees <hi>Diato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic;</hi> viz. <hi>Hemitone Major, Tone Minor,</hi> and <hi>Tone Major.</hi> The Firſt of theſe, ſome call <hi>Degree Minor;</hi> the Second, <hi>Degree Major;</hi> and the Third, <hi>Degree Maxim.</hi> Now theſe three Sorts of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees are properly to be intermixed, and ordered, in every Aſcent to an Eighth, in relation to the Key, or Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon given, and to the Affections of that Key, as to Flat, and Sharp, in our Scale of Muſic; ſo, that the Concords may be all true, and ſtand in their own ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled Ration. Wherefore if you change the Key, they muſt be changed too; which is the Reaſon why a Harpſichord, whoſe Degrees are fixed; or a fretted Inſtrument, the fretts remaining fixt, cannot at once be ſet in Tune for all Keys: For, if you change the Key, you
<pb facs="tcp:59863:83"/>
                     <pb facs="tcp:59863:84"/>
                     <pb n="155" facs="tcp:59863:84"/>withall change the place of <hi>Tone Minor,</hi> and <hi>Tone Major,</hi> and fall into other <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitones</hi> that are not proper <hi>Diatonic</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and conſequently into falſe Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals.</p>
                  <p>You may fully ſee this, if you draw Scales of Aſcent fitted to ſeveral Keys (as are here inſerted) and compare them. For an Example of this, Take the Firſt Scale of Aſcent to <hi>Diapaſon</hi> (I) <hi>viz.</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on C Key Proper, by <hi>Diatonic</hi> Degrees; (making the firſt to be <hi>Tone Minor,</hi> as convenient for this Inſtance) intermixing the <hi>Chromatic</hi> and other <hi>Hemitones,</hi> as they are uſually placed in the Keys of an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan; <hi>i. e.</hi> run up an Eighth upon an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan (tuned as well as you can) by half Notes, beginning at C <hi>Sol fa ut,</hi> and you will find theſe Meaſures. The Proper Degrees ſtanding right, as they ought to be, being deſcribed by <hi>Breves;</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by <hi>Semibreves:</hi> The <hi>Breves</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the <hi>Tones</hi> of the broad Gradual Keys of an Organ; the <hi>Semibreves</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:59863:85"/>the Narrow Upper Keys, which are uſually called <hi>Muſics.</hi> And let this be the firſt Scale, and a Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard to the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Then draw a Second Scale (II) run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning up an Eighth in like manner; but let the Key, or Firſt Note, be D. <hi>Sol re</hi> Proper, on the ſame Organ ſtanding tuned as before; which Key is ſet a Note (or <hi>Tone Minor</hi>) higher than the former.</p>
                  <p>Draw alſo a Third Scale (III) for <hi>D Sol re</hi> Key with Sharps, <hi>viz.</hi> Third, and Seventh, <hi>Major; i. e.</hi> F, and C, Sharp.</p>
                  <p>In the Firſt of theſe Scales, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees (expreſſed by <hi>Breves</hi>) are ſet in good and natural Order.</p>
                  <p>In the Second Scale (changing the Key from C to D). you will find the Fourth, and Sixth, a <hi>Comma</hi> (81 to 80) too much; but between the Fourth, and Fifth, a <hi>Tone Minor,</hi> which ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a <hi>Tone Major.</hi> So from the Fourth
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:59863:85"/>to the Eighth, is a <hi>Comma</hi> ſhort of <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pente;</hi> and from the Sixth, a <hi>Comma</hi> ſhort of 3d. <hi>Minor.</hi> And this, becauſe in this Scale, the Degrees are miſplaced.</p>
                  <p>The Third Scale makes the Second, Third, Fourth, and Sixth, from the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> each a <hi>Comma</hi> too much; and from the <hi>Octave,</hi> as much too little. In it, the 3d. Degree, between <g ref="char:sharp2">♯</g>F and G, is not the Proper <hi>Hemitone,</hi> but the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>Hemitone,</hi> 27 to 25. And all this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in this Scale alſo, the Degrees are miſplaced; and there happen (as you may ſee) three <hi>Tones Minor,</hi> and but two <hi>Major:</hi> the Deficient <hi>Comma</hi> being added to the <hi>Hemitone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have added one Example more, of a Fourth Scale; (IV) <hi>viz.</hi> beginning at the Key <g ref="char:sharp2">♯</g>C; with the like Order of Degrees, as in the Firſt Scale (from the Note C<g ref="char:sharp2">♯</g>) upon the ſame Inſtrument, as it ſtands tuned after the Firſt Scale. And this will raiſe the Firſt Scale half a Note higher.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>But in this Fourth Scale, the 1ſt. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, from <g ref="char:sharp2">♯</g>C to ♭E, is <hi>Tone Major,</hi> and <hi>Dieſis;</hi> as being compounded of 16 to 15, and 27 to 25.</p>
                  <p>The 2d. Degree from ♭E to F, is <hi>Tone Minor;</hi> therefore the <hi>Ditone,</hi> made by theſe two Degrees, is too much by a <hi>Dieſis,</hi> (128 to 125) and as much too little the <hi>Trihemitone,</hi> from the <hi>Ditone</hi> to the Fifth.</p>
                  <p>The 3d. Degree, from F to <g ref="char:sharp2">♯</g>F, is a <hi>Minor Hemitone,</hi> 25 to 24; which, (though a wrong Degree) ſets the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſaron</hi> right.</p>

You will ſtill find, that, by changing the Key, you do withall change and diſplace the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and make uſe of Improper De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and produce Incongruous Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals.</p>
                  <p>For inſtead of the Proper <hi>Hemitone,</hi> ſome of the Degrees will be made of other ſort of <hi>Hemitones;</hi> amongſt which chiefly are theſe two: <hi>viz. Hemitone Maxim.</hi> 27 to 25; and <hi>Hemitone Minor,</hi> or <hi>Chromatic,</hi> 25 to 24. Which <hi>Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tones</hi> conſtitute and divide the two <hi>Tones;</hi> viz. <hi>Tone Major,</hi> 9 to 8: the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:59863:89"/>Terms whereof Tripled, are 27 to 24; and give 27 to 25, and 25 to 24. The <hi>Tone Minor</hi> likewiſe is divided into two <hi>Hemitones:</hi> viz. <hi>Major,</hi> 16 to 15; and <hi>Minor,</hi> 25 to 24.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two ſerve to meaſure the <hi>Tones,</hi> and are uſed alſo, when you Divert in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Chromatic</hi> kind. But the <hi>Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone</hi>-Degree in the <hi>Diatonic Genus,</hi> ought always to be <hi>Hemitone Major,</hi> 16 to 15; as being the Proper Degree and Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between <hi>Tone Major</hi> and <hi>Trihemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone,</hi> between <hi>Ditone</hi> and a Fourth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Fifth and Sixth <hi>Minor,</hi> between Sixth <hi>Major</hi> and Seventh <hi>Minor,</hi> and alſo between Seventh <hi>Major</hi> and <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tave.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Muſic would have ſeem'd much Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier, if the Progreſſion of Dividing had reached the <hi>Hemitones:</hi> I mean, If, as by Dupling the Terms of <hi>Diapaſon,</hi> 4 to 2; it Divides in 4 to 3, and 3 to 2; <hi>Diateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaron,</hi> and <hi>Diapente:</hi> And the Terms of <hi>Diapente</hi> dupled, 6 to 4; fall into 6 to 5,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:59863:89"/>and 5 to 4, Third <hi>Minor,</hi> and Third <hi>Major;</hi> And <hi>Ditone,</hi> or Third <hi>Major,</hi> ſo Dupled, 10 to 8, falls into 10 to 9, and 9 to 8, <hi>Tone Minor,</hi> and <hi>Tone Major:</hi> If, I ſay, in like manner, the dupled Terms of <hi>Tone Major</hi> 18 to 16, thus divided, had given Uſefull and Proper <hi>Hemitones</hi> 18 to 17, and 17 to 16. But there are no ſuch <hi>Hemitones</hi> found in Harmony, and we are put to ſeek the <hi>Hemitones</hi> out of the Differences of Other Intervals; as we ſhall have more Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſee, when I come to treat of Differences, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p>I may conclude this Chapter, by ſhewing, how All Conſonants, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Concinnous Intervals, are Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of theſe three Degrees: <hi>Tone Major, Tone Minor,</hi> and <hi>Hemitone Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor;</hi> being ſeverally placed, as the Key ſhall require.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>Of Diſcords.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>BEſides the Degrees, which, though they conſtitute and compound all Concords, yet are reckoned amongſt Diſcords; becauſe every Degree is Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord to each Chord, to, or from which it is a Degree, either Aſcending, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending, as being a Second to it: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe I ſay, there are other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, ſome greater and ſome leſs. The leſs will be found amongſt the Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences in the next Chapter; and are fit, rather to be known as Differences, than to be uſed as Intervals.</p>
               <p>The greater Diſcords are generally made of ſuch Concords, as, by reaſon of miſplaced Degrees, happen to have a <hi>Comma,</hi> or <hi>Dieſis,</hi> or ſometimes a <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitone</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:59863:91"/>too much, or too little: And ſo become Diſcords, moſt of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of little uſe; only to know them, for the better Meaſuring, and Rectify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Syſtems.</hi> Yet they are found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Scales of our Muſic.</p>
               <p>Sometimes a <hi>Tone Major</hi> being where a <hi>Tone Minor</hi> ſhould have been placed, or a <hi>Tone Minor</hi> inſtead of a <hi>Tone Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor;</hi> ſometime other <hi>Hemitones,</hi> getting the place of the <hi>Diatonic Hemitone Major,</hi> and ſerving for a Degree, create unapt Diſcording Intervals: amongſt which may be found at leaſt two more Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds, two more Thirds, two more Sixths, and two more Sevenths. In each of which, one is leſs, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther greater, than the true Legitimate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals, or Spaces of thoſe Denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; as will be more explained in the enſuing Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>But beſides theſe (or rather amongſt them, for I here treat of Degrees as Diſcords) there are two Diſcords emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:59863:92"/>conſiderable, <hi>viz. Tritone,</hi> and <hi>Semidiapente.</hi> The <hi>Tritone,</hi> (or Falſe Fourth) whoſe Ration is 45 to 32, conſiſts of 3 whole Notes; <hi>viz.</hi> 2 <hi>Tones Major,</hi> and 1 <hi>Minor.</hi> The <hi>Semidiapente,</hi> (or Falſe Fifth) 64 to 45; is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of a Fourth, and <hi>Hemitone Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And theſe two divide <hi>Diapaſon,</hi> 64 to 32, by the Mediety of 45; And they divide it ſo near to Equality, that in Practice, they are hardly to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed, and may almoſt paſs for one and the ſame: but in Nature, they are ſufficiently diſtinguiſhed, as may be ſeen, both by their ſeveral Rations, and ſeveral Compounding parts.</p>
               <p>I think we may reckon Sevenths for Degrees, as well as among the greater Diſcording Intervals; becauſe they are but <hi>Seconds</hi> from the <hi>Octave,</hi> and are as truly Degrees Deſcending, as the Seconds are in Aſcent: though they be great Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals in reſpect of the <hi>Uniſon,</hi> and as ſuch may be here regarded.</p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:59863:92"/>
               <p> Theſe Diſcords, the <hi>Tritone,</hi> and <hi>Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diapente;</hi> as alſo, the Seconds, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venths, are of very great uſe in Muſic, and add a wonderfull Ornament and Pleaſure to it, if they be judiciouſly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged. Without them, Muſic would be much leſs gratefull; like as Meat would be to the Palate without Salt or Sawce. But, the further Conſideration of this, and to give Directions when, and how to uſe them; is not my Task, but muſt be left to the Maſters of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
               <p>Diſcords then, ſuch as are more apt and uſefull, (<hi>Intervalla Concinna</hi>) are theſe which follow.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Here, by the way, the Reader may take a little Diverſion, in practiſing to meaſure the Rations of ſome of thoſe Intervals, in the foregoing Catalogue of Diſcords, by comparing them with
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:59863:93"/>
                  <hi>Diapaſon;</hi> as thoſe of the Sevenths, which I ſelect, becauſe they are the moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Rations under <hi>Diapaſon: Viz.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth <hi>Minor,</hi> 9 to 5; and Seventh <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor,</hi> 15 to 8. Now to find what De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree or Interval lies between theſe and <hi>Diapaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, 9 to 5 is 10 to 5, wanting 10 to 9 (<hi>Tone Minor.</hi>) Next 15 to 8 is 16 to 8, wanting 16 to 15 (<hi>Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone Major.</hi>) So the Degree between Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth <hi>Minor</hi> and <hi>Diapaſon,</hi> is <hi>Tone Minor;</hi> and between Seventh <hi>Major</hi> and <hi>Diapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> is <hi>Hemitone Major.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then he may exerciſe himſelf in a Survey of what Intervals are comprized in thoſe ſeveral Sevenths, and of which they are compounded.</p>
               <p>Firſt, 9 to 5 comprizeth 9 to 8, and 8 to 5: Or 9 to 8, 8 to 6, and 6 to 5. Next, 15 to 8 contain 15 to 12, 12 to 10, 10 to 9, and 9 to 8: Or 15 to 12, and 12 to 8; Or 15 to 10, and 10 to 8, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſuppoſe, that the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:59863:94"/>Reader, before this, is ſo perfect in theſe Rations, that I need not loſe time to name the Intervals expreſſed by the Mean Rations, contained in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Rations of the Sevenths, which ſhew of what Intervals the ſeveral Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venths are compounded.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe, (by reaſon of Degrees wrong placed) there are two more 7ths. [falſe 7ths] one, leſs than the true ones; and another greater. The leaſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of two Fourths; whoſe Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is 16 to 9, and wants a <hi>Comma</hi> of 7th. <hi>Minor,</hi> and a <hi>Tone Major</hi> of <hi>Diapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:</hi> The other is the greateſt, called <hi>Semidiapaſon,</hi> whoſe Ration is 48 to 25; being a <hi>Dieſis</hi> more than 7th. <hi>Major;</hi> and wanting <hi>Hemitone Minor</hi> of <hi>Diapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now firſt, 16 to 9, is 16 to 8 (2 to 1) wanting 9 to 8; <hi>i. e.</hi> wanting <hi>Tone Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor</hi> of <hi>Diapaſon;</hi> and contains 16 to 10 (8 to 5) and 10 to 9. Or, 16 to 15, 15 to 12 (5 to 4) 12 to 10 (6 to 5)
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:59863:94"/>and 10 to 9. Next, <hi>Semi-diapaſon</hi> 48 to 25, is 50 to 25, wanting 50 to 48; <hi>i. e.</hi> 25 to 24 (viz. <hi>Hemitone Minor</hi>) of <hi>Diapaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the like happens, as hath been ſaid, to the other Intervals, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of <hi>Major</hi> and <hi>Minor;</hi> viz. 2ds, 3ds, and 6ths. The 4th, and 5th, and 8th, ought always to remain immutable; though they may ſuffer too ſometimes, and incline to Diſcord, if we aſcend to them by very wrong Degrees; as you may ſee in the II Scale in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chapter: where the Fourth having 2 <hi>Tones Major,</hi> is a <hi>Comma</hi> too much.</p>
               <p>All theſe Intervals may be ſubject to more Mutations, by more abſurd pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of Degrees, or of Differences of Degrees; but it is not worth the Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to ſearch farther into them. The Reader may take pleaſure, and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently Exerciſe himſelf in comparing and meaſuring theſe which are already laid before him.</p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:59863:95"/>
               <p> But to return from this Digreſſion. There are many unapt Diſcords, which may ariſe by continual Progreſſion of the ſame Concords; <hi>i. e.</hi> by Adding (for Example) a 4th. to a 4th, a 5th. to a 5th, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For it is obſervable, That, onely <hi>Diapaſon</hi> added (as oft as you pleaſe) to <hi>Diapaſon,</hi> ſtill makes Concord: But any other Concord, added to it ſelf, makes Diſcord.</p>
               <p>You will ſee the Reaſon of it, when you have conſidered well the Anatomy (as I may call it) of the Conſtitutive parts of <hi>Diapaſon;</hi> which contains, and is compoſed of 7 Spaces of Degrees, or of 4th. and 5th, or of 3ds. and 6ths, or of 2ds. and 7ths; which muſt all keep their true Meaſures and Rations belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, and otherwiſe are eaſily and often diſordered.</p>
               <p>Then, conſider <hi>Diapaſon</hi> as conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of two Fourths Disjunct, and a <hi>Tone Major</hi> between them. And this laſt is moſt needfull to be very well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered;
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:59863:95"/>as moſt plainly ſhewing the Reaſons of thoſe Anomalies, or Irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Intervals, which are produced by Changing the Key; and conſequently giving a new and wrong place to this Odd <hi>Tone Major,</hi> which ſtands in the midſt of <hi>Diapaſon,</hi> between the two Fourths Disjunct.</p>
               <p>Every 4th. muſt conſiſt of one <hi>Tone Major,</hi> one <hi>Tone Minor,</hi> and one <hi>Hemitone Major,</hi> as its Degrees, placing them in what Order you pleaſe; whoſe Rations, added together, make the Ration of <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſaron.</hi> And of theſe ſame Degrees contained in the 4th, are made the two 3ds, which conſtitute the 5th. <hi>Tone Major</hi> and <hi>Hemitone Major</hi> make the leſs 3d, or <hi>Trihemitone; Tone Major</hi> and <hi>Tone Minor</hi> make the Greater 3d, or <hi>Ditone; Trihemitone</hi> and <hi>Ditone</hi> make <hi>Diapente; Trihemitone</hi> and <hi>Tone Minor</hi> (as likewiſe <hi>Ditone</hi> and <hi>Hemitone Major</hi>) make <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſaron.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:59863:96"/>
               <p> Now this <hi>Tone Major,</hi> that ſtands in the middle of <hi>Diapaſon,</hi> between the two 4ths, which it disjoins; and the Degrees required to the 4ths, will not in a fixed Scale ſtand right, when you alter your Key, and begin your Scale of <hi>Diapaſon</hi> from another Note. For that which was the 5th, will now be the 4th, or 6th, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then the Degrees will be diſordered, and create ſome diſcording Intervals. If you continue conjunct Fourths, there will be a Defect of <hi>Tones Major;</hi> if you continue conjunct Fifths, there will be too many <hi>Tones Major</hi> in the Syſtems produced. And if a <hi>Tone Major</hi> be found, where it ought to have been a <hi>Tone Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor;</hi> or a <hi>Minor</hi> inſtead of a <hi>Major;</hi> that Interval will have a <hi>Comma</hi> too much, or too little. And ſo likewiſe will from a wrong <hi>Hemitone</hi> be found the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of a <hi>Dieſis.</hi> And theſe two, <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> and <hi>Dieſis,</hi> are ſo often Redundant, or Deficient, according as the Degrees happen to be diſordered or miſ-placed;
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:59863:96"/>that thereby, the Difficulties of fixing half Notes of an Organ in tune for all Keys, or giving the true Tune by Fretts, become ſo Inſuperable.</p>
               <p>You ſee, that in every Space of an Eighth, there are to be 3 <hi>Tones Major,</hi> and 2 <hi>Tones Minor,</hi> and 2 <hi>Hemitones Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor:</hi> One <hi>Tone Major</hi> between the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſaron</hi> and <hi>Diapente,</hi> and a <hi>Tone Major,</hi> a <hi>Tone Minor,</hi> and <hi>Hemitone Major</hi> in each of the Disjunct Fourths.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the Proper Degrees by which you ſhould always Aſcend or Deſcend through <hi>Diapaſon,</hi> in the <hi>Diatonic</hi> Kind; which <hi>Diapaſon,</hi> being the compleat Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem, containing all primary Simple <hi>Harmonic</hi> Intervals that are; (and for that reaſon called <hi>Diapaſon;</hi>) You may multiply it, or add it to its ſelf as oft as you pleaſe, as far as Voice or Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can reach; and it will ſtill be Concord, and cannot be diſordered by ſuch addition: becauſe every of them will contain (however placed) juſt
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59863:97"/>3 <hi>Tones Major,</hi> 2 <hi>Tones Minor,</hi> and 2 <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitones Major.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas, if you add any other Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val to it ſelf, the Degrees will not fall right, and it will be Diſcord, becauſe all Concords are compounded of une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Parts, as hath been ſhew'n before; and if you carry them in Equal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, they will mix with other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals by incongruous Degrees, and thoſe Diſordered Degrees will create a Diſſonant Interval.

               <p>ALL Rations and Proportions of inequality, have a Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, when compared to one another; and conſequently the Intervals, expreſſed by thoſe Rations, differ likewiſe. A Fifth is Different from a Fourth, by a <hi>Tone Major;</hi> from a 3d. <hi>Minor,</hi> by a 3d. <hi>Major;</hi> ſo an 8th. from a 5th, by a 4th. Of the Compounding parts of any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval, one of them is the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the other part and the whole In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval.</p>
               <p>But I treat now of ſuch Differences as are generally leſs than a <hi>Tone,</hi> and create the Difficulties, and Anomalies occurring in the two foregoing Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. I have the leſs to ſay of them

               </head>
               <p>TO Conclude all. Bodies by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion make Sound; Sound, of fitly Conſtituted bodies, makes Tune: Tune, by Swiftneſs of Motion is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred more Acute; by Slowneſs more Grave: in Proportion to the Meaſure of Courſes and Recourſes, of Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings or Vibrations of Sonorous Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Thoſe Proportions are found out by the Quantity and Affections of Sounding Bodies. <hi>Ex. gr.</hi> by the Length of Chords. If the Proportion of Length (<hi>Caeteris paribus,</hi>) and conſequently of Vibrations of ſeveral Chords, be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurate within the Number 6; then thoſe Intervals of Tune are Conſonant, and make Concord, the Motions mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:59863:106"/>and uniting as they paſs: If incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurate, they make Diſcord by the jarring and claſhing of the Motions. Concords are within a limited Number, Diſcords innumerable. But of them, thoſe only here conſidered, which are (as the <hi>Greeks</hi> termed them) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinnous,</hi> apt and uſefull in Harmony: Or which, at leaſt, are neceſſary to be known, as being the Differences and Meaſures of the other; and helping to diſcover the reaſon of Anomalies, found in the Degrees of Inſtruments tuned by <hi>Hemitones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All theſe I have endeavoured to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, with the manifeſt Reaſons of Conſonancy and Diſſonancy, (the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of a <hi>Pendulum</hi> giving much light to it,) ſo as to render them eaſie to be underſtood by almoſt all ſorts of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and to that end have enlarged, and repeated, where I might, to the more intelligent Reader, have compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed it very much ſhorter. But I hope
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:59863:106"/>the Reader will pardon that, which could not well be avoided, in order to a full, and clear Explanation of that, which was my deſign, <hi>viz.</hi> the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy of the Natural Grounds of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
               <p>Upon the Whole; You ſee how Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, and Naturally, all the Simple Concords, and the Two <hi>Tones,</hi> are found and demonſtrated, by Sub-diviſions of <hi>Diapaſon.</hi>

               </list>
               <p>In which are the Rations (in Radical, or Leaſt Numbers) of the <hi>Octave,</hi> Fifth, Fourth, Third <hi>Major,</hi> Third <hi>Minor,</hi> Sixth <hi>Major,</hi> Sixth <hi>Minor,</hi> and <hi>Tone Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor,</hi> and <hi>Tone Minor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then, All the <hi>Hemitones,</hi> and <hi>Dieſis,</hi> and <hi>Comma,</hi> are found by the Differences of theſe, and of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as hath been ſhewn at large.</p>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:59863:107"/>
               <p> Now, certainly, this is much to be preferred before any Irrational Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of expreſſing the ſeveral Intervals. The <hi>Ariſtoxenian</hi> way of dividing a <hi>Tone [Major]</hi> into 12 Parts, of which 3 made a <hi>Dieſis,</hi> 6 made <hi>Hemitone,</hi> 30 made <hi>Diateſſaron;</hi> (as hath been ſaid) might be uſefull, as being eaſier for Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Intervals belonging to the three Kinds of Muſick; and might ſerve for a leaſt common Meaſure of all Intervals, (like Mr. <hi>Mercator</hi>'s artificial <hi>Comma</hi>) 72 of them being contained in <hi>Diapaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this way, and ſome other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of dividing Intervals equally, by <hi>Surd</hi> Numbers and <hi>Fractions,</hi> attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome Modern Authors; could never conſtitute true Intervals upon the Strings of an Inſtrument, nor afford any Reaſon for the Cauſes of Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as is done by the Rational Way, explaining Conſonancy by united Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Coincidence of Vibrations. And though they ſuppoſed ſuch Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:59863:107"/>of Intervals; yet we may well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that they could not make them, nor apply them in tuning a Muſical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument; and if they could, the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals would not be true nor exact. But yet, the Voice offering at thoſe, might more eaſily fall into the true Natural Intervals. <hi>Ex. gr.</hi> The Voice could hardly expreſs the Antient <hi>Ditone</hi> of 2 <hi>Tones Major;</hi> but aiming at it, would readily fall into the Rational Conſonant <hi>Ditone</hi> of 5 to 4, conſiſting of <hi>Tone Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor,</hi> and <hi>Tone Minor.</hi> It may well be rejected as unreaſonable, to meaſure In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals by Irrational Numbers, when we can ſo eaſily diſcover and aſſign their true Rations in Numbers, that are <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute</hi> enough, and eaſie to be underſtood.</p>
               <p>I did not intend to meddle with the Artificial part of Muſick: The Art of Compoſing, and the Metric and Rhyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical parts, which give the infinite Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Air and Humor, and indeed the very Life to Harmony; and which
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:59863:108"/>can make <hi>Muſick,</hi> without Intervals of Acuteneſs and Gravity, even upon a Drum; and by which chiefly the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull Effects of Muſick are performed, and the Kinds of Air diſtinguſhed; As, <hi>Almand, Corant, Jigg,</hi> &amp;c. which vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly attack the Fancy of the Hearers; ſome with Sprightfulneſs, ſome with Sadneſs, and others a middle way. Which is alſo improved by the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of thoſe we call Flat, or Sharp Keys; The Sharp, which take the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Intervals within <hi>Diapaſon,</hi> as 3ds, 6ths, and 7ths. <hi>Major;</hi> are more Brisk and Airy; and being aſſiſted with Choice of Meaſures laſt ſpoken of, do Dilate the Spirits, and Rouze them up to Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry, and Magnanimity. The Flat, conſiſting of all the leſs Intervals, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract and damp the Spirits, and produce Sadneſs and Melancholy. Laſtly, A mixture of theſe, with a ſuitable <hi>Rhyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> gently fix the Spirits, and compoſe them in a middle Way: Wherefore the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:59863:108"/>Firſt of theſe is called by the Greeks <hi>Diaſtaltic,</hi> Dilating the ſecond, <hi>Syſtaltic,</hi> Contracting; the laſt, <hi>Heſychiaſtic,</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ſing.</p>
               <p>I have done what I deſigned, ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Natural Reaſons and Grounds, the Materials of Harmony; not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to teach the Art and Skill of Muſick, but to diſcover to the Reader the Foundations of it, and the Reaſons of the <hi>Anomolous Phoenomena,</hi> which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr in the Scales of Degrees and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals: Which though it be enough to my Purpoſe, yet is but a ſmall (though indeed the moſt certain, and, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently moſt delightfull) Part of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy of Muſick; in which there remain Infinite Curious Diſquiſitions that may be made about it: As what it is, that makes Humane Voices, even of the ſame Pitch, ſo much to differ one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? (For though the Differences of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Countenances are viſible; yet we cannot ſee the Differences of Inſtruments
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:59863:109"/>of Voice, nor conſequently of the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Colliſions of Air, by which the Sound is made.) What it is that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes the different Sounds of the Sorts of Muſical Inſtruments, and even ſingle Inſtruments? How the Trumpet, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Impulſe of Breath, falls into ſuch variety of Notes, and in the Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Scale makes ſuch Natural Leaps into Conſonant Intervals of 3d, 4th, 5th, and 8th. But this I find is very ingeniouſly explicated by an Honourable Member of the <hi>R. S.</hi> and publiſhed in the <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical Tranſactions,</hi> N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 195. Alſo how the <hi>Tube-Marine,</hi> or Sea-Trumpet (a <hi>Monochord</hi>) ſo fully expreſſeth the Trumpet; and is alſo made to render other Varieties of Sounds; as, of a Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, and Flageolet, whereof I have been an Ear-witneſs? How the Sounds of Harmony are received by the Ear; and why ſome perſons do not love Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:59863:109"/>
               <p> As to this laſt; the incomparable Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> mentions a certain Nerve in Brain, which ſome Perſons have, and ſome have not. But further, it may be conſidered, that all Nerves are compoſed of ſmall Fibres; Of ſuch in the Gutts of of Sheep, Cats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are made Lute-Strings: And of ſuch are all the Nerves, and amongſt them, thoſe of the Ear, compoſed. And, as ſuch, the latter are affected with the Regular Tremblings of Harmonic Sounds. If a falſe String (ſuch as I have before deſcribed) tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit its Sound to the beſt Ear; it diſpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Now, if there be found falſeneſs in thoſe Fibres, of which Strings are made; Why not the like in thoſe of the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Nerve in ſome Perſons? And then it is no wonder if ſuch an Ear be not pleaſed with Muſick, whoſe Nerves are not fitted to correſpond with it, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurate Impreſſions and Motions. I gave an Inſtance in <hi>Chap.</hi> 3d. how a Bell-Glaſs will Tremble and Eccho to its own
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:59863:110"/>Tune, if you hit upon it: And I may add, That if the Glaſs ſhould be irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly framed, and give an uncertain Tune, it would not anſwer your Trial. In fine, Bodies muſt be Regularly named to make Harmonic Sounds, and the Ear Regularly conſtituted to receive them. But, this by the by; and only for a Hint of Inquiry.</p>
               <p>I was ſaying, that there remain Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Curioſities relating to the Nature of Harmony, which may give the moſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Philoſopher buſineſs, more than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, to find out; and which perhaps will not appear ſo eaſie to demonſtrate and explain, as are the Natural Grounds of Conſonancy and Diſſonancy.</p>
               <p>After all therefore, and above all, by what is already diſcovered, and by what yet remains to be found out; we cannot but ſee ſufficient cauſe to Rouze up our beſt Thoughts, to Admire and Adore the Infinite Wiſdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Almighty God. His Wiſdom,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:59863:110"/>in ordering the Nature of Harmony in ſo wonderfull a manner, that it ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth our Underſtanding to make a through Search into it, though, (as I ſaid) we find ſo much by Searching, as does recompence our Pains with Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and Admiration.</p>
               <p>And his Goodneſs, in giving Muſick for the Refreſhings and Rejoycings of Mankind; ſo that it ought, even as it relates to common Uſe, to be an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our great Creator's Praiſe, as he is the Founder and Donor of it.</p>
               <p>But much more, as it is advanced and ordained to relate immediately to his Holy Worſhip, when we Sing to the Honour and Praiſe of God. It is ſo Eſſential a part of our Homage to the Divine Majeſty, that there was never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Religion in the World, <hi>Pagan, Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, Chriſtian,</hi> or <hi>Mehumetan,</hi> that did not mix ſome kind of Muſick with their Devotions; and with Divine Hymns, and Inſtruments of Muſick, ſet forth the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:59863:111"/>Honour of God, and celebrate his Praiſe. Not only, <hi>Te decet Hymnus Deus in Sion.</hi> (Pſal. 65.) but alſo —<hi>Sing unto the Lord all the whole Earth.</hi> (Pſal. 96.)</p>
               <p>And it is that, which is inceſſantly performed in Heaven before the Throne of God, by a General Conſort of all the Holy Angels and the Bleſſed.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, we are in Duty and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude bound to bleſs God, for our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull Refreſhments by the uſe of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick; But eſpecially in our publick De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, we are obliged by our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with Sacred Hymns and Anthems, to magnifie his Holy Name; that we may at laſt find Admittance above, to bear a Part in that Bleſſed Conſort, and Eternally Sing <hi>Allelujahs,</hi> and <hi>Triſagions</hi> in Heaven.</p>
